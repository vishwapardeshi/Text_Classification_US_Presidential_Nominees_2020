HARRIS,"[' Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons, totaled. This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I’m done. And we need action. And Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature, and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement, and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, ’cause it is time to act.']"
HARRIS,"[' So what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter, the same way, it does to Facebook.']"
HARRIS,"[' Who has spent full time… Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party. When Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party. What we need on this stage in November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that, we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together. I believe I am that candidate.']"
WARREN,"[' So let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means, it’s Medicare for all who can afford it, and that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare for all is the gold standard, it is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who’s just gotten an Tom Steyer diagnosis, that’s how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, I’ve laid out the basic principles, costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they’re going to go up for big corporations, they will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law if that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about. I’ve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt.']"
WARREN,"[' This morning. I announced this morning that I’m not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives, we’ve already agreed, Bernie and I, we’re not taking any money from big pharma executives. You can’t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices…']"
HARRIS,"[' You asked earlier about China. It’s a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on this stage, the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottomline is this, Donald Trump in office on trade policy, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz, when you pull back the curtain, it’s a really small dude.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy. And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don’t agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress and we should be united in taking the fight to them.']"
BOOKER,"[' I’m so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants’ rights lawyer, these are all good points. But we’re not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification, and low income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation. And so all of these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we’ve got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up. The mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you are a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you’re paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners. And what that does is it actually slashes poverty, 10 million people out. And, by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people, when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer it’s not the landlord, it is also low-income family struggling to stay in their home.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' And this president indicated early on what he was going to do and he’s done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail, then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail, so no surprise that we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia and Alabama where his allies are passing these bills, and what we have to remember is that the people are with us, and I predict this will be a big election… An issue in the general election, and I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him, “You know what, the people are with us.” Over 70% of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need. He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we’re going to win this election.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, the President clearly has no strategy. When I first got into this race, I remember President Trump scoffed and said he’d like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. I’d like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.']"
BOOKER,"[' First of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish', ' No. Look, on, let’s just be clear, the factory farming going on that’s assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don’t line up with our values. That’s what I’m calling for. But I want to switch because we don’t have a crowded debate stage. We were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq. It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn’t say one word about veterans in our country. We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms. They’re disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that as we, as a country, understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us. We end our national anthem with, Home of the brave. It’s about time we make this a better home for our bravest.']"
SANDERS,[' On the Medicare for all the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they’re not gonna be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.']
OROURKE,"[' I would, in my first term in office, agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war already in its 18th year, that will make it any better. We’ve satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place, and it’s time to bring those service members back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen and Somalia and Libya and Syria. There’s no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight. As president, I will end those wars and we will not start new wars. We will not send more US service members overseas, to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name, we can resolve these challenges…']"
GABBARD,"[' This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue, this is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face, these are the kinds of conversations that we’re having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Independents coming together saying, “Hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we’re able to raise our kids in a community that’s safe.” It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about, as president.']"
BIDEN,"[' This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were… He’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain, John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was my… He was assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends, he became very close friends with my wife Jill, Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, “John, you didn’t see a war you never wanted to fight.” And he’d say, “You didn’t see a problem you never wanted to solve.” But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable, he was honorable. And one of the things that’s the reason why I’m running, we have to restore the soul of this country. That’s why I’m doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.']"
BIDEN,"[' And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big… No, I really mean it. It’s a gigantic issue. And we have to make it clear from the top, from the president on down, that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture.']"
STEYER,"[' And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis and I’ve been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since, successfully. And that’s why I’m running for president because our government has failed, it’s been bought by corporations and it’s absolutely essential to return power to the people.']"
STEYER,"[' So I’m friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who’s fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She’s a different gender, she’s a different race, she’s from a different part of the country, but she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor. My mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools, and in the Brooklyn house of detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II, and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, “When you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day, and every single day after.” And that’s why I started the Need to Impeach Movement two years ago because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.']"
BIDEN,"[' Yes. And by the way, it’s one of the reasons… The first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. In fact, I didn’t write the reauthorization. I wrote the original Act. The fact is that what happens now is that we, in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. That’s why as Vice President… And when I asked the President, I could start the movement on the college campuses to say, “It’s on us.” It’s everyone’s responsibility. We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with… I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25, and found out I said, “What do you need… What do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools?” You know what they said? “Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.” And that’s when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' So, we don’t have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better than… Or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test. That’s the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal. That way, if people like me are right, that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we’ll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option, and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off…']"
BIDEN,"[' The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies. They are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. That were strongly against ObamaCare. They know it cost them, and it’s going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who’ve negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it.']"
GABBARD,"[' These are wars that have cost us as American taxpayers trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard-earned tax payer dollars actually into serving the needs of the American people right here at home.']"
OROURKE,"[' The question was about tarrifs, and they’re a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard. And farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences. When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners? As president, we will hold China accountable, but we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear. And we’ll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor. Not just here in the United States but in the…']"
SANDERS,"[' And second of all, second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters… Nobody more pro-union than me up here… Are now paying high deductibles and co-payments and when we do Medicare for All instead of having the company putting money into health care, they can get decent wage increases, which they’re not getting today.']"
BOOKER,"[' I will lead an effort to make sure that we re-write our immigration laws in that way. Never cage another child, make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody, but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job, that we have been part of deporting people, hundreds of thousands, just in the Obama administration alone, who posed no threat to this country, breaking up their families. Democrats have to get off the back foot. We have to lead on this issue because we know it is right, legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million dreamers, make them US citizens right now, and this their true home country. And extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers, and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' We need a new foreign policy in this country, and that means renewing our relationships with our allies, it means rejoining international agreements, and it means reasserting our American values. And so, when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the country, across the world that that was okay, and that’s wrong. And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said. First of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia, and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the new START Treaty, and when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long term like I do, just like the Chinese do, because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet, and they are in it for the long game.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' We can and must do that, but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker. ‘Cause when I come… Where I come from, a lot of times, that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We’ve got to say that and bring people together.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait. People are dying in the streets right now. We can’t wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can’t wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don’t wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can’t wait for Red Flag laws or go in to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.']"
BOOKER,"[' And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal. In my city, we have racial divides, we have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling. The success of my city was ’cause we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn’t be done. When I am president of the United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed. My charge is to see a nation right now which has so much common pain, to channel that back into a sense of common purpose. And I will do whatever it takes, bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before.']"
HARRIS,"[' When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one-and-a-half and three-years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I’ve been in the United States Senate, for now, the last two-and-a-half-years, and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children, and then when they look at the mirror, I don’t know what they see, but it’s a lack of courage. And this is an issue that, yes, it represents an existential threat. It is also something we can do something about. This is a problem that was created by human behaviors, and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet, I’ve seen it happen in California.']"
WARREN,"[' What I do have a problem with is that, if we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives, if we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives. So long as that’s…']"
WARREN,"[' So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hard-working middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot, and I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, “Sorry, we’re not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we’re not covering your expensive treatment for Tom Steyer, we’re not covering what you need.”']"
HARRIS,"[' Sure. And everybody, please visit my website, KamalaHarris.org, for the details on everything I talk about. Six months. So, part of how I believe we’re going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today, and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.']"
HARRIS,"[' My plan is as follows', ' For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not that law will not go into effect, that’s called pre-clearance, because the reality is that while we still have, as I said earlier, these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence. But I’ll go further, you may have seen, I questioned Brett Kavanaugh, when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him, as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was No. The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that and it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision.']"
WARREN,"[' I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online. We have to have the courage, not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces. We want to make real progress on climate, then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country.']"
HARRIS,"[' I am. And I will tell you, as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged…']"
HARRIS,"[' So, six months’ paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women’s lives today. The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, Black women 61 cents, Native American women, 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.']"
HARRIS,"[' Well, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot. And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president, from what we heard today, the vice president, the secretary of state, and the chief of staff. And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue. And back to the question that you asked earlier, which is, what does this mean for the American people? ‘Cause what it means, when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America', ' The powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else.']"
WARREN,"[' Look, I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49% of all sales online happen in one place', ' That’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.']"
WARREN,"[' So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this, costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations, and for middle class families they will go down, I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.']"
WARREN,"[' Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that 2 cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one tenth of 1% in this country and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country age zero to five. That is transformative. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every child care worker and pre-school teacher in America. We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation’s future.']"
HARRIS,"[' And yes, we can, because I’ll tell you something. The way that I think about this is, I’ve seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing to act, it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school. I was talking about this at one of my town halls and this child, it was eight years old, probably, came up to me, it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, “I had to have one of those drills.” It is traumatizing our children. El Paso and Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. You know, people asked me in El Paso, they said… ‘Cause I have a long standing record on this issue, they said, “Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?” And I said, “Well, look, I mean, obviously, he didn’t pull the trigger, but he’s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.”']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' The problem, Bernie Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote and that Elizabeth Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway. Now, look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the Anderson CooperA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we’re right as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don’t you?']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values. Look, I didn’t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it’s also the case that a small number of specialized Special Operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS. Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time, they feel ashamed, ashamed of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking what the hell happened to American leadership. And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.']"
BOOKER,"[' So I’m hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that… And the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I’ve lived in public housing projects, almost for a decade, and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don’t have a school that serves your genius. I think I’m the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results. A lot of folks here talking about raising teacher salary, we actually did it in Newark, New Jersey and we didn’t stop there. We closed poor performing charter schools, but dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community, the results speak for themselves, we’re now the number one city in America for beat the odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.']"
SANDERS,"[' What I am talking about, and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments. And Jake Tapper, your question is a Republican talking point. At the end of the day, and by the way…']"
GABBARD,"[' Transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry instead of investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people, leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.']"
OROURKE,"[' We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been, and right now we have a President who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life, I’ve been including people in the success of this country. Starting a small business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. And in Congress being in the minority, but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. And then in Texas, this last year. Traveling to every county. Not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. And at the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the State. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans. And those 38 electoral college votes in Texas are now in play, and I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.']"
SANDERS,"[' To the original point. The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying Black people or people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system, through Citizens United, which allows billionaires to buy elections. So, what we need to do, simple and straightforward, in every state in this country, through the federal government, if you are 18, you have a right to vote, end of discussion. We have to overturn Citizens United, we need to move towards public funding of elections.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' If it’s true, that if we embrace a far left agenda, they’re gonna say, we’re a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they’re gonna do? They’re gonna say, we’re a bunch of crazy socialists. So, let’s just stand up for the right policy, go out there, and defend it.']"
BIDEN,"[' Secondly, I… You know, I’m part of that Obama coalition. I come out of the Black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the Black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the Black caucus, the only African-American woman that ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people. My point is…']"
BIDEN,"[' Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle-class, and the only way we’re going to do that is be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey, it’s about your dignity.” We have to restore people’s dignity. And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it’s time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for God’s sake, get up, get up, and remember, this is the United States of America, there’s nothing, nothing we’re unable to do when we decide we’re going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.']"
BIDEN,"[' Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things', ' Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one; and, number two, is going to have to… Be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That’s what I’ll do. You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place. And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate? And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee. That’s pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that… While at the same time innocent people in the Donbass are getting killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president. So I’ve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question', ' Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I think you can buy into it. That’s the idea of Medicare for All Who Want it. Look, this is a distinction without a difference whether you’re paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look, in this country, if you have health coverage… If you don’t have health coverage you’re paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage you’re paying too much for care.']"
BIDEN,"[' So my point is… And one of the reasons I was picked to be Vice President was because of my relationship, longstanding relation with the Black community. I was part of that coalition.']"
SANDERS,"[' I am the son of an immigrant, a young man of 17 who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. I have some sense of the immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail. And I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination, racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together.']"
OROURKE,"[' It’s an honor to be on this debate stage. It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at Tom SteyerU. On August 3rd in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is, the cost and the consequence of his presidency. A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our President. The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of molehills. We have to be bigger, we have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That’s what I want to do for you as President of the United States. Thank you.']"
GABBARD,"[' Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness and attacks that are unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exists in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty. This is something that I’ll do as president and Commander-in-Chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.']"
SANDERS,"[' Let’s be clear, what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years, the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying, and campaign contributions. That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they’re paying in the United States.']"
BOOKER,"[' Strategies like investing in our children work. And I’ll tell you this, I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues. That’s why my friend Secretary Castro was 100% right. We are in the reality we are right now because, Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime. That were redlining communities, disinvesting in communities and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of under-funded schools, but they’re also struggling with environmental injustice. If you’ve talked to someone who’s a parent of a child who’s had permanent brain damage because of lead, you’ll know this is a national problem, because there’s over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' What we are doing, or what we were doing, in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too. When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with US forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I believe what’s deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this President, and we have a chance to change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us, that’s why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It’s not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one, and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms compound, in the same way that a dollar saved compound, so does a dollar stolen. And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries. I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshalling as many resources as went into the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time a Douglass Plan that we invest right here at home to make sure that we’re not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25% the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs.']"
HARRIS,"[' Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable. And finally, my plan is about making sure that in America’s criminal justice system we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And, as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.']"
WARREN,"[' But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using… You’re getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it. And here’s the thing. That’s something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about. Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we’re going to make a real change.']"
WARREN,"[' So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle class families, costs will go down. The way I see this is, I have been out all around this country, I’ve done 140 Town Halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico, should have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I’ve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter has been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I’ve talked to the young man who has Tom Steyer and here is the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning, but then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.']"
WARREN,"[' Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves, and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.']"
HARRIS,"[' And I’ll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science, because her mission in life was to cure cancer, and so she arrived in California and she got… She was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the Civil Rights movement, she met my father and that produced my sister and me, they got married, but when I was five that marriage ended. But my mother convinced us that we could do anything, and so I became the first woman Attorney General of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate. And I will tell you, that’s part of why I’m running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible, and I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals, will always hold true. And so that’s what is at stake in this election, and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.']"
HARRIS,"[' So, on paid family leave. It is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s, often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare, to all of the activities that are required, much less the healthcare needs that are required. And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice, whether they’re going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on.']"
HARRIS,"[' Well, I was asked a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But, listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue, and I’ll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the Mayor has made apologies for that. The larger issue is that for too long, I think, candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies and have… You know, they show up when it’s, you know, close to election time and show up in a Black church and want to get the vote, but just haven’t been there before. I mean, you know, there are plenty of people who applauded Black women for the success of the 2018 election, applauded Black women for the election of a Senator from Alabama. But, you know, at some point, folks get tired of just saying, “Oh, you know, thank me for showing up,” and say, “Well, show up for me. Because when black women…']"
HARRIS,"[' It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.']"
WARREN,"[' Thank you. I listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas, but I take a look at the issues we’ve talked about. We’ve talked about climate change, we’ve talked about defense spending, we’ve talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence.']"
WARREN,[' That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country. Early educational opportunities for every child. Universal pre-K no matter where you live for every three-year-old and four-year old. Raising the wages…']
WARREN,"[' I didn’t spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of healthcare. And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we’ve got right now is the overall cost of healthcare. And look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I’ve spent my entire life on working on how America’s middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is…']"
BOOKER,"[' So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president from office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn’t rip us apart. Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' It’s original, I’ll give you that. The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we’ve ever seen. As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what’s at stake in our national leadership. We keep sending politicians to Washington, asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans. We just marked the anniversary of 9/11. All day today, I’ve been thinking about September 12th, the way it felt, when for a moment, we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. That’s what presidential leadership can do. That’s what the presidency is for, and that is why I’m asking for your vote.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it’s not about the tariffs. Look, what’s going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us, more than anybody else. And there’s a lack of a bigger strategy.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer, but this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Elizabeth Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in and the thing is, we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself, but the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to, and if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family, and it can be delivered without an increase on the middle class taxes.']"
SANDERS,"[' Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system, 87 million uninsured or underinsured, $500,000, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying, while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit. Five minutes away from here John is a country. It’s called Canada. They guarantee healthcare to every man, woman and child as a human right, they spend half of what we spend. And by the way, when you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all. Healthcare is a human right. It’s not a privilege. I believe that, I will fight for that.']"
SANDERS,"[' Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about healthcare for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time. And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all. Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out of pocket expenses. That’s where we gotta go.']"
OROURKE,"[' And I want to say this. I’m listening to the people of this country. The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and Amy Klobuchar-47s and those who were buying those weapons. And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there. Folks who said, “I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don’t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.” So, let’s do the right thing, but let’s bring everyone in America into the conversation, Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, and non-gun owners alike.']"
BIDEN,"[' Now, with regard to China, we should… Look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China and what they’re doing with the million Uighurs that are there, essentially, in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally, vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community too, far too many times. It’s the worst part of being Mayor. Getting the phone call. Consoling grieving parents. And we have a mass shootings worth of killings every day in this country. What we’re doing hasn’t worked, because we haven’t had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want. 80, 90% of Republicans want universal background checks. Not to mention the common sense solution… Laws, that disarm domestic abusers, and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons, things like what I carried overseas in uniform that have no business in American neighborhoods in peacetime, let alone anywhere near a school. I was at an event a few days ago, and a 13-year-old asked me what we we’re gonna do about school safety and then began shaking and then began crying. And we could talk about these policies, but we already know the policies. The only thing I could think of looking into the eyes of this child is, we’re supposed to be dealing with this, so you don’t have to. High school is hard enough, without having to worry about whether you’re going to get shot.']"
BIDEN,"[' It just… We, look… It’s about civility; we have to restore the soul of this country. And that’s not who we are, that’s not who we’ve been, that’s not who we should be. Follow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.']"
BIDEN,"[' Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I’d let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated; that’s not the role of the president of the United States. It’s the attorney general of the United States, not the president’s attorney, private attorney, and so I would… Whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment, that he violated the law and should be in fact criminally prosecuted, then so be it, but I would not direct it. And I don’t think it’s a good idea that we mock… That we model ourselves after Trump and say, “Lock him up.” Look, we have to bring this country together. Let’s start talking civilly to people and tweeting… The next president who starts tweeting should… Anyway…']"
BIDEN,"[' Yes, and I said at that time, Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe in the order of the Crown Prince. And I would make it very clear, we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them. We were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There’s very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia. And I would also, as pointed out, I would end, end the subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis where they’re going in and murdering children and they’re murdering innocent people. And so, they have to be held accountable.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' This is the exact same conversation we’ve been having since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We’d better not allow there to be a third. Something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do. They won’t prevent every incident, they won’t save every life, but we know what to do, and it has not happened.']"
OROURKE,"[' If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers, when we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren’t enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your Amy Klobuchar-47.']"

GABBARD,"[' Working side by side, let’s defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump, come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace, inclusion and true equality. Working side by side, let’s make Dr. King’s dream our reality.']"
SANDERS,"[' No, he’s right. We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand, today, that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country and yet we got 87 million uninsured, under-insured. In some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, it’s a mistake on the part of Republicans who enable the president, whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law, or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it’s going to be like, what it’s actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in April? It’s one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage, people take note. Not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word, or follow through on its plans. And when that happens, there are serious consequences. We saw it at the G7, the leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world, sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change. And there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been. The problem is, this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever. Whether it’s in Hong Kong, where those protesters for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States, or anywhere around the world where, increasingly, we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America, but it can’t be just any America. It has to be…']"
BOOKER,"[' The lesson I learnt of resilience is to trust people, ’cause the power of the people is always greater than the people in power, and the test of America right now, it’s not a referendum on Donald Trump, it’s a referendum on us, on who we are and who we’re going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there’s nothing we can’t do together as a nation.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' There’s good news and bad news. I’m gonna start with the bad news. Our country is in trouble. GDP is going up and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. It’s only getting tougher. By 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate; there are gonna be 130 million more guns on our streets. I’ll be in my 40s then. If you have kids, think about how old they will be then. But here’s the good news, it’s not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time. In 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn’t have to wonder if it could support us. To deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement. That we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats. We can do this. If and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn’t worked with bold action, and win. Not only defeat this President, but defeat his Congressional allies. With a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience, as well as bringing Democrats to office. Join me and let’s make it happen.']"
HARRIS,"[' I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn’t the courage, the talent or the will to see us this far. I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All. I always have. But I wanted to make the plan better, which I did, which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So, under my Medicare for All plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan because that’s what people want, and I agree we shouldn’t take choice from people. But here’s the thing, everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well-intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don’t have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly, on this subject and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.']"
WARREN,"[' So the data show that we’ve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations have been calling the shots on trade. Giant, multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line. I have a plan to fix that, and it’s accountable capitalism. It says you want to have one of the giant corporations in America, then by golly, 40% of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, “Gee. We could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico.” When there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, “No. Do you know what that does to our company? Do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?” We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.']"
WARREN,"[' So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East, I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn’t understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis, he has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life. I sit on the Armed Services Committee, I talk with our military leaders about this.']"
WARREN,"[' What do these issues have in common? Well, first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. And what is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it, and the majority of Americans are with us on it, and yet we don’t make change. Why not? Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies that it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms instead of into our public schools. We have a government that works for those at the top, and not for anyone else.']"

HARRIS,"[' When Black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America, when the sons of Black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death, when Black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women, who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be, “Where you been? And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?”']"
HARRIS,"[' I would urge you to join me, because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down. We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.']"
HARRIS,"[' He was born… He has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland, and to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation, and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure, is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that, when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth and we are loyal. What Donald Trump has done, from pulling out of the Paris Agreement, to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.']"
WARREN,"[' No, let me finish please. And cancel student loan debt for 95% of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax? It’s why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?']"
WARREN,"[' So, look, I want to get what works, done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn’t register them, and a huge tax on them, and we let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people. But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you’ve rightly identified, it’s not just about mass shootings, it’s what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide. It is about domestic violence. This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things, and then we’re done. We have to reduce gun violence, overall. And the question we have to ask is', ' Why hasn’t it happened? You say we’re so close, we have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013.']"
HARRIS,"[' So, there have been… I’m glad you asked me this question. And there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I’ve always wanted to protect people and keep them safe. And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias, and I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside. And so, I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model, and became a national model, around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time. I created one of the first in the nation trainings for police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system. Was I able to get enough done?']"

BUTTIGIEG,"[' I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for all who want it which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place allows you to get that healthcare. It’s just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not, and I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years when we could achieve that same big, bold goal and once again, we have a president… We’re competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we’ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided, why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there. By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment. We saw what’s going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels. I’ll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform is, do not let these men and women down. This president is doing exactly that. I will not.']"

SANDERS,"[' The fact of the matter is, tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs, when their employer changes that insurance.

BIDEN,"[' First of all, let me say that when I came back from law school, I had job with a great and big-time law firm and left and became a public defender, because my state was under siege. When Dr. King was assassinated, we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I’ve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with red-lining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etcetera. The fact of the matter is that what’s happened is that we’re in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn’t be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem; they should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.']"
OROURKE,"[' That’s a mischaracterization, Anderson. I’ve got to answer this. Never took you, or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue, but when you, Pete Buttigieg, describe this policy as a shiny object, I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an Amy Klobuchar-47, March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians. That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an Amy Klobuchar-47.']"
OROURKE,"[' Thank you. Listen, I’m grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now. But I also think we’re being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like that works for them to force them onto Medicare and others who want to, as the Vice President does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is a county jail system. We’ve got to do better. And my proposal, Medicare for America says, everyone who’s uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who’s insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare and those, like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families are able to keep them. That is the best possible path forward.']"
GABBARD,"[' The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.']"
BIDEN,"[' You know, we can do this without charging people, raising $30, $40 trillion. The fact is, that right now, the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all. It couldn’t pass the United States Senate. Right now, with Democrats, it couldn’t pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn’t think it makes sense. We should build on ObamaCare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go to the route of my two friends in my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance. And if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here’s the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them, what the insurance companies, they want no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' When I’m President, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law. But we’ve got a crisis on our hands and it’s not just a crisis of immigration, it’s a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our Southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America. Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly, we’ve been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime. Protections for Dreamers, making sure that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, cleaning up lawful immigration. We know what to do, we know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is, we haven’t had the will to get it done, in Washington. And now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement. But he needs it to be a crisis, rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.']"
BIDEN,"[' Well, first of all, I’d go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea, he has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un, who’s a thug. Well, he points out that I am a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick. Very recently, it was a comment that’s…']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' That’s the policy I’m putting forward, not ’cause I think it’s the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats here, because I think it’s the right answer for people like my mother-in-law, who is here, whose life was saved by the Anderson CooperA, but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her.']"
BIDEN,"[' They in fact can in fact put pressure on North Korea. But, the fact is that we’re in a position where he has done this across the world. He’s embraced thugs, look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is… His whole effort is to break up NATO, to increase his power. Look what he’s done to it. And so, this guy has no idea what he’s doing, he has no notion how to go about it, and we need a Commander-in-Chief who when he stands, everybody knows what he or she is talking.']"
BIDEN,"[' I think a woman is qualified to be president, and there’s no reason why, if you think the woman is the most qualified person now, you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is, number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, I’ve passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to dealing with Milosevic, the whole range of things that I’ve been engaged in my whole career.']"
GABBARD,"[' Thank you. I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I’ve introduced legislation called the Securing America’s Elections Act, that mandates paper ballots, to make sure that every single voter’s voice is heard. But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comments about experience. Pete, you’ll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans, by itself, does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you, as president, would be willing to send our troops to Mexico, to fight the cartels. As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands…']"
OROURKE,"[' I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then, and I was talking about it long before then as well. Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country, not at the 4th of July, 1776, but August 20th, 1619 when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave, built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy. We have to be able to answer this challenge, and it is found in our education system where in Texas, a five-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin, in our healthcare system where there’s a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there’s 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America. I’m going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee’s lead and sign into law a reparations bill to allow us to address this at its foundations.']"
OROURKE,"[' Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Andrew Yang just described and also just from some personal experiences I’ve had as a member of Congress, where constituents of mine have come forward. In some cases publicly at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions. I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street, because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. Now, imagine if that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana, because we made that legal in America, ensured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted. I also want to agree with Amy Klobuchar', ' Until we hold those responsible, accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we’re going to continue to have this problem going on again. So, that veteran that I met and anyone with drug addiction today is not a problem for the criminal justice system, they are an opportunity for our public health system in America.']"
BIDEN,"[' I’m the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so, we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released, they shouldn’t be in there for a… That should be a misdemeanor. They should be out, and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned. When you finish your term in prison, you should be able, not only to vote, but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way. I’ve laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is, we’ve learned so much more about…']"
SANDERS,"[' As the author of the Medicare Bill, let me clear up one thing. People talk about having insurance. There are millions of people who have insurance, they can’t go to the doctor, and when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt. Alright?']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Step one is, appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education. I believe in public education and in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we’ve got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we’ve just got to pay teachers more, and we’ve got to lift up the teaching profession. I was thinking of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan, they had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher and they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well, and she came up just short, so you know what she did, since she was academically good but couldn’t quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall back plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession. If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.']"
BOOKER,"[' Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy. We have seen it in the ’16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform and antitrust. I mean, Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust from pharma to farms is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws. And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage, going back to the fact that we… It’s rich to me that we asked three people about their health. When looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I’m all for a wealth tax. I’m all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell you, though, how this looks from the Industrial Midwest where I live. Washington politicians, congressmen and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn’t even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad’s Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school. I didn’t know that wasn’t every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy, it’s a Chevy Cruze, used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers. But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It’s because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he’s unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is the time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention to who sounded better on the debate stage or in a committee hearing, versus what it’s actually going to take to get…']"
BOOKER,"[' My biggest professional setback is embarrassing ’cause a lot of folks know about it. I with a bunch of tenant leaders in New York, New Jersey in 2002, took on the political machine, and boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed, our campaign offices were broken into, my phones were tapped, it became a spectacle and we lost that election. And here’s a bit of advice to everybody, if you’re going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called Street Fight. But then unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dagnab Penguins for crying out loud. The people in my community living in the projects told me, “Don’t give up on the people and the people won’t give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions and you’re going to win.”']"
HARRIS,"[' So let’s talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it and then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o’clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump’s administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans. And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they’re going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it, but let’s focus on the end goal. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of office, he’s going to get rid of all of it.']"

And right now in America, the top one 10th of 1% have so much wealth.

HARRIS,"[' So, my policy is about… There’s a whole collection of work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.']"
HARRIS,"[' They have… And I’ve seen it happen before. I’ve taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I’ve seen what they do. The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic. And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing, false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let’s end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let’s go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they’ve been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.']"
WARREN,"[' So, let’s be clear about healthcare and let’s actually start where the Vice President did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America and committed this country to healthcare for every human being.']"
WARREN,"[' I wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade and, let’s be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else. I’ve already made my commitment, we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher. I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top 1/10th of 1% in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal childcare for every baby age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it.']"
OROURKE,"[' I wanna acknowledge something that we’re all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country, the wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force. The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country. Today, as president, I will sign into law a new voting rights act, I will focus on education, address health care disparities, but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee’s reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we have waited too long in this country to have.']"
YANG,"[' Elizabeth Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected. If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes; instead we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we could generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century, because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro-democracy, anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell’s hands in the United States Senate. We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote, and, in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression, or gerrymandering, that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins. Right now, we have politicians picking out their voters, rather than the other way around. That, compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote, means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' That’s right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I’m not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values. For example, the idea that women’s reproductive freedom is an American right. What I’m talking about is reforms that will de-politicize the court. We can’t go on like this where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological fire fight over what to do next. Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis. There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits, don’t forget justices used to just retire like everybody else, to a rotation off the appellate bench.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' That’s not my record. We are here at a historically black college, and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said. She said, “What the people want is simple. They want a country as good as its promise.” And that same could be said of the criminal justice system. So, when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the Prosecutor’s Office, they were handled with a grand jury. That’s how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it.']"
YANG,"[' Everyone, we know we’re on the same team here, we know we’re on the same team, we all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president, and I believe we’re talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits, and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend they’re contractors, it’s harder to change jobs, it’s certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.']"

And so, I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence. And we need to address that.']"
SANDERS,"[' They are people fleeing violence and I think the main thing that we’ve got to do, among many others, Beto made this point. We’ve gotta ask ourselves, “Why are people walking 2000 miles to a strange country where they don’t know the language?” So what we will do, the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we rebuild Honduras…']"
SANDERS,"[' I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel. 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt. For what reason? They came down with cancer. I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit. Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And if we don’t have the guts to do that, if all we could do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.']"
BIDEN,"[' We’ve all been through that, in some form or another. And it just takes… It just, for me, the way I’ve dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is do what I’ve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy and… But there’s a lot of people went through a lot worse than I have, get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had, there are real heroes out there, some real heroes.']"
BIDEN,"[' Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Elizabeth Warren said, we can’t be running any vague campaigns. We’ve got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done. And if you can get it done. I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but, I’m the only one on this stage who’s gotten anything really big done. From the Violence Against Women Act, to making sure that we passed the Affordable Care Act, to be in a position where we, in fact, took out almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression.']"
GABBARD,"[' That our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington represented by Hillary Clinton and others’ foreign policy, by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests. I’m running for president to be the Democratic nominee that rebuilds our Democratic Party, takes it out of their hands, and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country, and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm’s way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of American lives.']"
CASTRO,"[' Jorge, let me just say that I would… I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I’m not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue, I’m not going to back-pedal, I’m not going to pretend like I don’t have my own vision for immigration, so we’re not going to give up DAnderson CooperA, we’re not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20 of 2021, we’re going to have a Democratic President, we’re going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, and we’re going to pass immigration reform within the first 100 days.']"
CASTRO,"[' Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump, Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants, he built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that’s very different from Barack Obama. But my problem with Joe Biden, and Cory pointed this out last time, is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, “Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there. That’s me too.” And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, “Well, that was the President.” I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama’s work, but not have to answer any questions.']"
GABBARD,"[' But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump, we need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation. So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by and for the people that serves all the people of this country, and visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.']"
BIDEN,"[' Making us in a… Putting us in a position where I was able to end Roe v… Excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales, in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, how… Who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.']"
BIDEN,"[' Yes, they have. I said from the beginning, that if in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president, and I agree with Bernie, Bernie Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all. Will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.']"
SANDERS,"[' Damn right, we will, and I’ll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, etcetera. Furthermore, and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight, this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems, which don’t have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt, we’re going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.']"
SANDERS,"[' I think we have got to do… I think what I meant is what President Obama said, in that nobody up here is gonna tell you that we have a magical solution to the crisis. Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And as president, I suspect it will be an F record. What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA. You asked me about my record. Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the Straw Man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.']"
CASTRO,"[' Thank you very much for the question. I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn’t uncommon to hear gunshots at night, and I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other. In the neighborhoods, though, let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one', ' Folks can’t define it, and if you’re not going to door door-to-door then it’s not really mandatory. But also in the places that I grew up in, we weren’t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door.']"
YANG,"[' I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors. And they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentive. So instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the healthcare system. And the Cleveland Clinic, where they’re paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe. Shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter, and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards, who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window. What changes did we make? Go after white collar crimes in a big way, diversify the office in a big way, worked with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eye witness ID. And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don’t just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the second step act, which means the 90% of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let’s reduce those sentences from non-violent offenders and let’s get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' If I had a buck for every argument that I’ve witnessed like this I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I’ve been alive. We’re being offered a false choice. I don’t agree with the Vice President that Trump is an aberration. I don’t agree that there’s any such thing as back to normal, because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn’t work. That’s part of how we got here. That’s part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. But I also don’t agree with Elizabeth Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight. Absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it’s going to take more than fighting.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' And while these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency.']"
YANG,"[' Of course, we have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is we’re falling apart at home. So we voted in Donald Trump, and he’s now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy. We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We’ve tampered with other elections, you’ve tampered with our elections, and now it has to stop, and if it does not stop we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this, but Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats, artificial intelligence, cyber security, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors. These are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology. We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified in Congress the nature of the questioning. As commander-in-chief, I will help pull us forward.']"
OROURKE,"[' We’ll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities to hear him say “Send her back” about a member of Congress, because she’s a woman color, because she’s a Muslim-American, doesn’t just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants “rapists and criminals,” or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that’s comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise, every single one over the last three years. On the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground. So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election, but we must also ensure that we don’t just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them. That’s what we’ve learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown. One of the safest cities in the United States of America, not despite, but because it’s a city of immigrants and asylum seekers, and refugees. We will show that our diversity is our strength in my administration.']"
WARREN,"[' Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet, and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say we have less and less time than we thought we had, but that means we’ve got to use all the tools. One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed, following Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings, by 2030, carbon emissions from cars, and by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70%. We can do this. We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time, why doesn’t it happen? As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can’t make the changes we need to make. We have to attack the corruption head-on so that we can save our planet.']"
WARREN,"[' From the time I was seven years old, I had a dream. I wanted to be a public school teacher, but my daddy ended up as a janitor and by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have the money to send me off to college. My big chance, was what was then, a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. For me, what this election is all about, is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about, is about who’s going to get opportunity. Is it gonna go to the billionaires or is it gonna go to our kids? Right now for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. And that means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms, and small communities across this country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote, and we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country. Not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires, but actually building it person-by-person across this country. With small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, “I have a stake in this democracy” I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, I’ll start to make real change come 2021.']"
BOOKER,"[' The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. It’s one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington to create city-issued municipal IDs. So that people regardless of immigration status in our city had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification. We have an opportunity to actually get something done, but we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines, often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values, values of welcome, values of faith that all argue, for us to manage this humanly and in a way that marries our values with our laws.']"
WARREN,"[' I mentioned earlier I’ve known what I wanted to be since second grade; I wanted to be a public school teacher. And I invested early, I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had four-to-six-year-olds. But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant.']"
WARREN,"[' And now the question is how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations are going to pay more and middle class families are going to pay less. That’s how this is going to work.']"
YANG,"[' Elizabeth Warren, I’ve been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they’re smart. They see what’s happening around them. Their main street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald’s, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one. Three-and-a-half million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks. What is that going to mean for the three-and-a-half million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problems is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.']"
YANG,"[' I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data, because right now, unfortunately, we’re living in a world where data is the new oil and we don’t have our arms around it. These are the ways that we’ll actually get Russia to the table and make it so that they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I think simply because you have different ideas doesn’t mean you’re fighting for regular people. I wouldn’t even be up on this stage if it wasn’t for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn’t have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn’t have survived. If my mom didn’t have unions as a teacher, she wouldn’t have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced. So just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio, we can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite…']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn’t care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn’t care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not, we just learned to trust each other. It’s like the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there, is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I’ll follow in the pattern tonight and point out, you could go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it. It’s also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that’s what friendship and that’s what service can create, and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I was talking about US-Mexico cooperation. We’ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation. And the military relationship, that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can’t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying they don’t have to buy in, you’re forgetting that. I mean, look…']"
YANG,"[' When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants, and you hope it works out. It’s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians. That’s why I’m going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that. This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.']"
SANDERS,"[' John, I was a mayor, and I helped transform my city. I have some practical experience. Second of all, on… Interestingly enough, today is the anniversary of Medicare, 54 years ago, under Linda Johnson of the Democratic Congress, they started a new program. After 1 year, 19 million elderly people in it. Please don’t tell me that in a four-year period, we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on earth wants. We are the odd dog out.']"
BIDEN,"[' The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, etcetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right. And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman’s right to choose is based. And that’s what I would do. No one would get on the court.']"
BIDEN,"[' And I… It took… Kierkegaard said, “Faith sees best in the dark.” Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident and my two sons were badly injured, and I had just been elected, not sworn in, and I lost my faith for a while. It came back. And then later, when my son, Beau, came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease, and a year later, a year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do. And that’s why I hope he’s proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn’t run for president, but I stayed engaged because when you get hit badly, whether you’re losing a job or you’re raising a family, like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid, “You can’t live here anymore. Dad lost his job.”']"
STEYER,"[' Last time I was on the stage I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House. And I stand by that statement. But I’m different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington DC is broken. I know that it’s been purchased by corporations and I’ve spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations. I’m the only one on this stage who’s willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself. Term limits. That if we’re going to make bold changes we’re going to need new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who’s spent decades building an international business. Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump, what he is, a fraud and a failure on the economy, which is his strong point.']"
CASTRO,"[' Sure, thank you, Jorge. I’ll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator. And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they’ll have free and fair elections, and also, here in the United States, offer a temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans.']"
CASTRO,"[' That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do for all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community. He has failed, I will not. I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall Plan for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home, instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And, under my administration, we’re going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They’re our neighbors, and we have a lot of things in common. It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States need to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.']"
STEYER,"[' I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that it’s our biggest challenge, but it’s our biggest opportunity to recreate this country. If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, I’m the person who can do it.']"
BIDEN,"[' I never counted any professional setback I have as a serious setback. There are some things that are important, things that are unimportant.']"
BIDEN,"[' I would not get into court packing. We add three justices, next time around we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all. I want to point out that the justices I’ve supported, when I defeated Robert Bork, and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman’s right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump, including the battleground states of Michigan, where I won the Democratic primary. Wisconsin, where I won the Democratic primary and Pennsylvania. And the reason we are gonna defeat Trump, and beat him badly, is that he is a fraud and a phoney and we’re gonna expose him for what he is. The American people want to have a minimum wage, which is a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. I’ve helped lead that effort. The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs, not the highest prices in the world. I’ve helped lead the effort for that as well.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' On page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it, and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance, that’s in four years. I don’t think that’s a bold idea. I think it’s a bad idea. And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option, a non-profit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I know that it’s par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies and said, “Guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.” That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth. So we have different ways. I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Once again I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we’ve attempted in my lifetime. Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the ’80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students. Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn’t count unless we go even further. Free college for low- and middle-income students isn’t good enough unless we’re also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn’t enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we’ve done in my lifetime.']"
YANG,"[' The third thing I would say is that we’re going to live up to our international commitments. We’re going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances, including NATO. And it was James Mattis that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition. That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus, not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and what’s going on in Hong Kong.']"
YANG,"[' We have a freedom dividend of $1000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families, in our communities. It helps all Americans transition because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio, if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. We put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.']"
WARREN,"[' Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost, that’s what they have to deal with and understand, families are paying for their healthcare today, families pay every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, you can’t see that specialist,” every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.” Families are paying every time they don’t get a prescription filled because they can’t pay for it. They don’t have a lump checked out because they can’t afford the co-pay. What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is on Medicare for All costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work, under Medicare for All in our healthcare centers.']"
WARREN,"[' And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me… Wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So there I am, I’m at home, I got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, “I’ll go to law school!” And the consequence was I practiced law for about 45 minutes, and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. But it let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. And the reason I’m standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what’s broken, I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That’s why I’m here.']"
BOOKER,"[' I do, and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstays. But I think the larger question that we’re trying to get at is how do we re-write this country’s immigration laws in our own image, in the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America. In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe, not despite the fact that we’re a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants.']"
WARREN,"[' Because no one can describe it and the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military. I have three older brothers who all served in the military. I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do, but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve. We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.']"
WARREN,"[' What you’re saying is ignore the law. Laws matter, and it matters if we say, “Our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge, who come here seeking asylum”, that is not a crime. And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but does not criminalize the activity of a mother fleeing here for safety.']"
WARREN,"[' Well, I start with a statement of principles. And that is in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger.']"
YANG,"[' Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. And so I spent seven years starting and running a non-profit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Wen, who’s here in the audience tonight who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me. But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I think we agree. I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place. What I don’t like is how this president has handled it. You’ve heard of the Truman Doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine. He’s done the go-it-alone Doctrine with the rest of the world. He’s taken us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran Nuclear Agreement, out of the Russian Nuclear Agreement and I don’t agree with that. And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote. Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, lost their life in a church at the height of the Civil Rights Amendment. So I do believe you meet with people, but you better have an agenda, and you better put our interest of our country first, not the Russians.']"
YANG,"[' My father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor. And now his son is running for president. That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share with the American people. If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants, and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism. And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration. I think we have to compete for talent. And I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says build a wall. I’m going to say to immigrants, come to America because if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president. The water’s great, and this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life. This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success and that is where I would lead as president.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we’re in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn’t exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns. We have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize not polarize that majority. For example, on healthcare. The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around. Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people on to it whether they want to or not. And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Elizabeth Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.']"
BOOKER,"[' This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African-American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams right now. And that is, when you have undemocratic means, when you suppress people’s votes to get elected, those are the very people you’re going to come after when you’re in office, and this bill, opposed by over 70%, the Heartbeat Bill here, opposed by over 70% of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day that whoever is a nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low income and minority voters, and particularly the Black community that you saw here in Georgia.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Thank you. You know, this isn’t a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t get any of this done, on climate change or immigration reform, unless they win. And what I have done is win, I’m the only one up here, time and time again the reddest of red districts. Michele Bachmann’s, I won that district three times. Rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it’s comfortable but where it’s uncomfortable. And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania, and in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, and all over Ohio and in Iowa. Because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' My response is, I completely agree, and I welcome the challenge of connecting with Black voters in America who don’t yet know me. And before I share what’s in my plans, let me talk about what’s in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse, and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.']"
CASTRO,"[' I think that that should be reflected more in our public life. I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George Stephanopoulos W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks. I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they’ve done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions, and there are people, whether it’s our former President George Stephanopoulos W. Bush or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn’t be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they’ve done.']"
SANDERS,"[' Look Steve, ain’t nobody in the Congress who’s more strongly pro worker than I am. So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition. Alright, we can create… And what the Green New Deal is about, it’s a bold idea. We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti worker.']"
BIDEN,"[' It’s crazy, the teachers are… I’m married to a teacher, my deceased wife was a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does in fact have three, four and five-year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not they don’t want to help, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television… Excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, make sure the kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school or a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.']"
BIDEN,"[' I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being, having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they’re not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful. Shameful what this man has done.']"
BIDEN,"[' Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that’s what we should be focusing on. And what I wanted to make a point about, and my son’s statement speaks for itself, he spoke about it today. My son’s statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it’s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th… Look, the fact that George Stephanopoulos Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He’s going after me because he knows, if I get elect… If I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.']"
CASTRO,"[' Right. And I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his home of El Paso. He’s done a great job with that. Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this President… 10 hours inspired by this President to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out. I’m proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I’m also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we’re not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn’t represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart, they also need a leader to match that, and I will be a President that matches that.']"
CASTRO,"[' Thank you. And I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this and of course we owe a debt gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama and Joe Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan, is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn’t true, when Kamala Harris brought that up, there was a fact check of that and they said that was true. I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse, but that whole time she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available. If they choose to hold on to strong solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that, but the difference between what I support, and what you support, Joe Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt-in, they would automatically be enrolled, they wouldn’t have to buy in. That’s a big difference, because Barack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered, he wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.']"
BIDEN,"[' Look, my son’s statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We’ve always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say. And let’s focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump’s corruption. That’s what we should be focusing on.']"
BIDEN,"[' But here, look, but here’s the deal. Think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he’ll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is re-elected, I promise you there will be no NATO. Our security be vastly underrated, under… And we will be in real trouble. And with regard to regime change in Syria that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border. And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq… Excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria. We have ISIS is going to come here. They are going to in fact damage the United States of America. That’s why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.']"
BIDEN,"[' No, I’m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Here’s the deal. The deal is that we’ve got this a little backwards, and by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro, I’ve confronted Maduro. Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I’m the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries in fact change their system so people don’t have a chance to leave. You’re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn’s legislation, which is called “10-20-30.” And what that understands is that as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in health care, in education, in financial services, we are gonna have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities. In terms of education, I also have a plan, it’s called the Thurgood Marshall Plan. And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America, it would triple funding for title one schools, it would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.']"
CASTRO,"[' Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you, Anderson and thank you, Erin and CNN and the New York Times and everybody who’s here tonight. You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I’ve had, have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me, also teachers. As I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine and sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think, people who thought differently from me. Folks that I considered and have considered friends and I think that there’s a value to that.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' For me, it’s John McCain and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, he’d say, “Amy Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.” And I still remember being there at his ranch, John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words said this, “There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.” That’s what we’re doing right now.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized and cast aside, and oppressed in society. And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country. Turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two elections ago, lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that it’s not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now. In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he’s been appealing to. I don’t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don’t even golf. As a matter of fact, I never thought I’d be on a Forbes magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage.']"
BOOKER,"[' Thank you, Rachel. It’s an honor to be here tonight. I have not yet qualified for the December stage and need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help. I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break a man named John Lewis and perhaps it’s interesting and important for me to mention why I’m so grateful to him. I’ve been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change. Not just beat Donald Trump, that’s the floor; we need to go to the ceiling, we need to go to the mountain top. I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago, there was a lawyer on a couch, who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them mine, who were discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer’s activity.']"
YANG,"[' I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal. Because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China. A CEO friend of mine was in China recently, and he said that he saw a pirated US intellectual property on worker workstations, to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said one, how can my workers compete against that. And two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies. So the imbalances are real, but we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides. So no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the 10 of us, is much stronger than what divides us. And I think that’s true of our country, too. Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House.']"
YANG,"[' You know, I think about everyone who’s ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard. Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice. And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.']"
WARREN,"[' And unless we’re willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we’re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, “Let’s do background checks, let’s get rid of assault weapons.” And with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack the systemic problems, we can’t get done reform in this country. We’ve got to go straight against the industry, and we’ve got to change Congress, so it doesn’t just work for the wealthy and well-connected. So it works for the people.']"
WARREN,"[' No, it is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street, and CEOs and their lobbyists and their lawyers and I beat them. I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator and I beat him. I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn’t get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn’t get elected. But here’s where we are. I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared, but we can’t choose a candidate we don’t believe in just because we’re too scared to do anything else. And we can’t ask other people to vote for a candidate we don’t believe in. Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for Democrats to win you can’t be afraid either.']"
WARREN,"[' I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer. I think it may have been Senator McCain’s last trip before he was sick. And I talked to people, we did. We talked military leaders, American and local leaders. We talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through. Show me what winning looks like, tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of…']"
HARRIS,"[' So we’re in a fight, this is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. And it’s a fight we need to win. And to fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and I have taken on Jeff Session, I have taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh. I know I have the ability to do that. We also need someone who can unify the party and the country, and who has the experience of having done that. I’ve done that work. I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race, their gender, their party affiliation, where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks.']"
WARREN,"[' We don’t expand trust around the world by saying, “You know, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon.” That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk, right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon. The world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.']"
WARREN,"[' So, let’s be clear, I’ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I’ve met people who like the doctors, I’ve met people who like their nurses, I’ve met people who like their pharmacists, I’ve met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to healthcare. And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we’re going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every healthcare provider is covered and the only question here, in terms of difference is where to send the bill?']"
WARREN,"[' So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades, and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations, and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they’ll do it in a heartbeat. And yet, for decades now, who’s been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators, who has shaped our trade policy? It’s been the giant corporations. It’s been their lobbyists and their executives. The way we change our trade policy in America is first, the procedures. Who sits at the table? I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table. I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.']"
YANG,"[' I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don’t like your job? What if you’re not good at your job? The fact is most Americans do not want to work for the federal government, and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace. Also, Bernie Sanders’ description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who’s at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' If I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all, Bernie Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals, that was the Klobushar-Sanders amendment, to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada. We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that’s a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figured that’s a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price. But when it comes to our healthcare and when it comes to our premiums I go with the doctors’ creed, which is do no harm. And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill and on page 8…']"
YANG,"[' Let me be clear, I am pro-good school. I’ve got a kid… One of my little boys just started public school last week and I was not there because I was running for President. So we need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' We need to reprioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It’s not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway growth in military spending, it’s also where. Right now, we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we both fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building, just turn into bigger targets. We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he’s relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall. There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian, diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics and it is not a part of the campaign, but the President’s conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we’re learning more about in the investigations, but just to be clear, the President’s already confessed to it on television. But that’s just part of what we’ve seen. Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the President had to confess in writing in court to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrong-doing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.']"
CASTRO,"[' Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable not only financially but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it’s these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should’ve been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.']"
SANDERS,"[' No, there is a reason why in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies. I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which caused this country over 4 million good paying jobs. And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs, making 50% of what they made in manufacturing. So Trump, obviously, hasn’t a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three o’clock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. We’re losing billions right now because of Trump’s policy. A trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad, and then thinks they’re going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.']"
SANDERS,"[' I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas. They could give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations. They could bail out the crooks on Wall street. So please don’t tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry, and nothing happens unless we do that. Here is the bottom line. We’ve gotta ask ourselves a simple question, what do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet? I say that is criminal activity.']"
BIDEN,"[' Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are one point… There’s $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly, I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to, we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy, we’re going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody’s right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs, it is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting and buying back their stock and still doing the same thing.']"
BIDEN,"[' Because I’ve watched it. I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged… Look, one of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because of I know what has to be done, I’ve done it before, I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren’t racist, they just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so I would appeal to them. But I don’t think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop. The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education, and we pay teachers more, and we make sure there’s a decent retirement system in place… Yes, we help the African-American community and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we’ve seen in the last decades, but we help everyone. So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.']"
CASTRO,"[' There will be life after Donald Trump. But the truth is that our problems didn’t start just with Donald Trump, and we won’t solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision. Universal pre-K and universal healthcare, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living. But first, we have to win, and that means exciting a young diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That’s what Kennedy did, it’s what Carter did, it’s what Clinton did, it’s what Barack Obama did, and it’s what I can do in this race. Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I wanna make it easier for kids to go to college. And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college. There’s no difference. It says, “Everyone is free.” I don’t think that makes sense. And I’m very concerned if we do things like that. The debt we’re gonna pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So what I would do about student loan debt, is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate. And I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them, so that you literally over five, 10 years, can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don’t have enough workers. I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy, with our education policy.']"
BIDEN,"[' I’m the only one in this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them. And beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets, and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred. The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street, are not on the street, that people own, is to do what we do in the National Firearms Act, as it relate to machine guns, you must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. I’m the only one that got it moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I’ve done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That will change.']"
BIDEN,"[' No, look. Demonizing wealthy… What I talked about is how you get things done, and the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax, and I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter. It’s ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, Detroit was mentioned, and I’m delighted that Detroit is rebounding, but let us understand Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the street, as they moved to low wage countries. To win this election and to defeat Donald Trump, which by the way, in my view, it’s not gonna be easy, we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision. We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen, by and among other things.']"
SANDERS,"[' No. But what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation. The gun legislation that people here are talking about. Medicare for All. Climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you could do it in a variety of ways. You could do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is in order, and what is not. But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made. And then, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else. What we are looking at is a corrupt political system. And that means, whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what’s happening in Washington or, in this case, you got an NRA, which has intimidated the President of the United States and the Republican leadership. I am proud… I am proud that year after year, I had an F rating from the NRA, and as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.']"
CASTRO,"[' I don’t think it is. I wouldn’t pack the court. I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits, or having people cycle off from the appellate courts, so that you would have a replenishment of perspective. I would also make sure that I appoint, as President, people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment, because you shouldn’t only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice, and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' And we’re seeing a rise in the deaths from despair. I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, it is the unification of the American people. And I’m asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn’t have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said, “I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.” By the way, this isn’t even making farmers whole, if you’re in soy beans, for example, you’re getting killed, and it’s not just what this president’s done with the trade war; in a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers which are killing those who are involved in ethanol. Look, I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team. But more and more, I’m talking to people in rural America who see that they’re not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.']"
YANG,"[' So to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies? Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? And the answer is this, we all know, everyone on the stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now, everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts, money finds a way, money will find its way back in. So what is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with people-powered money. My proposal is that we give every American a 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates in causes that you like, this would wash out the lobbyists’ cash by a factor of eight to one, that is the only way we will win and as someone running for President, and I’ll tell you, there’s the people on one side and the money on the other, the only way for us to win is if we bring them together.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' We have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead. I think we need something different. I am someone that tells the truth. I don’t make promises that I can’t keep. I have people’s back. And I believe that to win, you bring people with you, and that is how you govern as well. So you’re going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great, but if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I’ve got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me, because I don’t want to be the President for half of America, I want to be the President for all of America.']"
YANG,"[' If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed…']"
WARREN,"[' Yes, and I’ll tell you why. What we’re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States. It is not helping the safety and security of the world, it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home. And then, we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily. We’re not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem. And that means we need to be working with all of our allies', ' Our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism. It means using all of our tools. It means economic investment, it means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.']"
WARREN,"[' So, let’s be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won’t have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won’t have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies, people who have sick family members won’t have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for healthcare for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare coverage.']"
WARREN,"[' We have to have an announced policy that is one the entire world can live with, we need to make that clear. We will respond if someone else does but not first.']"
BOOKER,"[' Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump’s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists. The question isn’t who isn’t racist, it’s who is and isn’t doing something about racism. And this is not just an issue that started yesterday, it’s not just an issue that we hear a president that can’t condemn white supremacy, we have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from healthcare to the criminal justice system. And it’s nice to go all the way back to slavery, but, dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850. We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it. If I am President of United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes, and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare, to even one that we don’t talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.']"
WARREN,"[' For decades, we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multinational corporations to help giant multinational corporations. They have no loyalty to America, they have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they’ll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, they’ll do it in a heartbeat. I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we’re not gonna do it that way. We’re gonna negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table. And then we’re gonna use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America’s markets. They wanna sell to you.']"
WARREN,"[' I think that what we have to do is we have to be an America that is clear about what we wanna do with immigration. We need to expand legal immigration. We need to create a path for citizenship, not just for Dreamers, but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas. We need to fix the crisis at the border. And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trump’s hands. He wants to stir up the crisis of the border because that’s his overall message. It’s if there’s anything wrong in your life, blame them.']"
WARREN,"[' I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers, but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people who’ve overstayed student visas and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable. Down at the border we’ve got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values.']"
YANG,"[' The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists and radiologists. It does not care about our party. Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016, what did he say? He said we’re going to build a wall, we’re going to turn the clock back, we’re going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things, we have to turn the clock forward, we have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible, we have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020.']"
BOOKER,"[' Because of a massive diminution. A lot of reasons, but there was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' And I believe we need to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government, recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best-run communities in the heartland before the other way around starts to happen.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' So I went to the legislature, our state legislature, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay. And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee, so they outnumbered the lobbyists two to one. And when they said, “When should it take place?” They all raised their hand, and said, “Now.” That is what motivated me to go into public service and when I got to that gridlock of Washington DC, I got to work and pass over 100 bills and I know a lot of my friends here are from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country. And I believe if we’re going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone’s going to not just change the policies. But change the tone in the country and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew, you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail. That is exactly what the Alabama law is, it put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75% of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90% of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You de-funded Planned Parenthood, I would fund it again.']"
CASTRO,"[' And thank you George Stephanopoulos, to Jorge, to Linsey and to David and to all of you all for tuning in tonight. In many ways I shouldn’t be here on this stage. Castro is my mother’s name and was my grandmother’s name before her. I grew up in a single parent household, on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools. Eventually my brother Joaquin and I became the first in our family to become professionals, and when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000, a few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council, and the City Council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year, so everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm.']"
SANDERS,"[' We need a healthcare system that guarantees healthcare to all people, as every other major country does. Not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. And to tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the healthcare industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.']"
SANDERS,"[' I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism, and make it clear that we, as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.']"
SANDERS,"[' Matter of fact, I do. But before I get into that, the major issue that we don’t talk about in Congress, we don’t talk about in the media, is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America. You got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90%. You have a top 1% that owns more wealth than the bottom 92%. 49% of all income goes to the top 1%. Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax. And we’ve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street. What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans, they’ll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period.']"
STEYER,"[' When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school, it determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work. What we’ve seen in California is as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units, and that affects everybody in California. It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of California.']"
BIDEN,"[' Well, they have to deal with the… Look, there is institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Redlining banks, making sure that we are in a position where… Look, talk about education, I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the title 1 schools. Triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year, give every single teacher a raise, a equal raise, of getting out of $60,000 level. Number two, make sure that we bring in to help… The teachers deal with the problems that come from home, the problems that come from home. We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Yes. What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large, big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for it. The people are with us now. After Parkland, those students just didn’t march. They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family, and they said, “There must be a better way.” Then we elected people in the House of Representatives, and guess what? It changed. And they passed universal background checks. And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell’s doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president, I will take them on.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Everyone wants to get elected. But my point is this, I think, when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10,000 lies, that we better be very straightforward with the American people. And no, do I think that we are gonna end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I don’t think we’re gonna do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all wanna see which is lower costs for healthcare. Do I think that we’re gonna vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I don’t think we’re gonna do that. So that’s what I’m talking about. But what I don’t like about this argument right now, what I don’t like about it at all, is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election.']"
BIDEN,"[' And it was later when we came into office, that Barack, the president turned to me and said, “Joe… ” when they said we got to plan to get out, he turned to the whole security, and said, “Joe will organize this. Get the troops home.” My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand, and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming, from moving in.']"
STEYER,"[' I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units. But the other thing that’s going to be true about building these units is we’re going to have to build them in a way that’s sustainable. That, in fact, how we build units, where people live, has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability. So, we are going to have to direct dollars, we’re going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who’ve worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we’re going to have to force it and then we’re going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50% of their income on rent.']"
GABBARD,"[' Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well-founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don’t know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives. And I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. This has to do with bad trade deals that we’ve seen in the past, that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have, but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can’t forget that.']"
SANDERS,"[' Yeah, okay. You’re looking, I believe, at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us over 4 million jobs, but also help lead the effort against these agreements. Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you’re mistaken. If they can save $0.05 cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or any place else, that’s exactly what they will do. As president, let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough, they want military contracts, they want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ain’t gonna get those contracts if you throw American workers out on the streets.']"
SANDERS,"[' David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the Vice President said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.']"
SANDERS,"[' Joe said that Medicare for All will cost over $30 trillion. That’s right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years, will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country. I who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we’re going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.']"
CASTRO,"[' And it was the first test that I had. And I think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered, before I went in, whether it would change who I was, and I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There’s nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me President, I won’t, I won’t serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an America that’s better than ever. Thank you very much.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Yeah, I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market. I had a life before government and what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way, in the long distance market. Well, right now, we have another Gilded Age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the antitrust committee. I have the lead legislation, which means one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we’ve been talking about here, is breaking down some of these consolidation and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they’re so overwhelmed. But the issue here is this, start talking about this as a pro-competition issue, this used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a start-up slump in this country and this means everything from tech on down.']"
BOOKER,"[' And so these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community, and if we don’t have somebody authentically… We lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example. We lost in Wisconsin…']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I also wore the uniform of this country and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done. I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' My challenges, and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and after his third Dave WeigelI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family and in his words, he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace. And then got married, my husband’s out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter and our daughter was born. I had this expectation we were going to have this perfect, perfect birth and she was really sick. And she couldn’t swallow and she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half, but when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care and I was kicked out, and I thought, “This could never happen to any other mom again.”']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging. And so must our campaign. I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we’ve been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country. I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we’re building, and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create. I hope you go to peteforamerica.com, join this effort and help us create a better era for the American people beginning in November 2020.']"
YANG,"[' First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. If you don’t feel like you answered your question… You got your question answered tonight it’s understandable, there are 12 of us. I’m going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My website yang2020.com, and if you ask your question tonight there’s a better chance I’ll get to it. My surprising friendship, it’s been so much fun running for president because I’ve gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who’s an average Trump supporter, a trucker, he let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail, I heard about his experiences, trying to get other people off of drugs and I’m happy to say that after our ride together he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me and we’ve remained in touch ever since.']"
WARREN,"[' We need… I want to add one more part on this because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border, in no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering. We need to restore that help, we need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law, so that people don’t feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically. We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.']"
WARREN,"[' Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize, that’s the whole point. What we’re looking for here is a way to take away the tool that Donald Trump…']"
OROURKE,"[' The answer is no, the middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class healthcare. I think we’re being offered a false choice. Some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins, others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path. Medicare for America, everyone who’s uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare.']"
WARREN,"[' What the Congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs and we can build the trade deals that do it. People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is, let’s make them raise their standards. Make them pay their workers more, let their workers unionize, raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they wanna be able to sell their products. Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals. It’s just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that.']"
BOOKER,"[' Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There’s no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs, or dealing drugs, but if you’re African-American, you’re almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stevenson says treats you better if you’re rich and guilty, than if you’re poor and innocent. And so, I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America and all of us should come forward and say, “When we are President of the United States, when I am President of the United States, we will release them,” and let me be specific.']"
BOOKER,"[' There are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us, that are afraid because they are in crisis, they don’t have health insurance, their health insurance doesn’t go far enough, they can’t afford their prescription drugs. Look, I’m clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe it’s the best way to rationalize the system, but dear God, I know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions. And I’ll tell you, there is an urgency right now, in this nation, everybody feels it. And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity. Because people in my community, they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now. And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and we cannot lose it, by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans, but every single day I’ll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.']"
WARREN,"[' Because it makes the world safer. The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively and we need to say so to the entire world. It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculates, someone misunderstands. Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe. And what’s happening right now with Donald Trump as they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they could be used, puts us all at risk. We talk about what’s happening around the world. I have three older brothers who served in the military, I see that they would do anything. Our military is the best on earth but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution. We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools and if we’re gonna send someone into war, we better have a plan for how we’re gonna get them out on the other end.']"
OROURKE,"[' Every estimate that I’ve seen of expanding Anderson CooperA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the healthcare that they need, as the example, that Elizabeth Warren showed us. Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance. When we listen to the American people, and this is what they want us to do, they want everyone covered, but they want to be able to maintain choice.']"
WARREN,"[' So we have to think of this in terms of the big frame, what’s the problem in Washington, it works great for the wealthy, it works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. What it’s going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a God-given right to make $23-billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system.']"
YANG,"[' As usual, Elizabeth Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move. But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all of the problems. It’s not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today.']"
YANG,"[' We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth. But here’s the big one, the data clearly shows that 65% to 70% of our students’ outcomes are determined outside of the school. We’re talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they’re young, stress levels in their house, income, type of neighborhood, we’re putting money into schools, and educators know this, we’re saying you’re 100% responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30%, they all know this. The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach.']"
BOOKER,"[' When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7th, 1965, he was watching a movie called Judgment at Nuremberg on TV, and they interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And there he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers. We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again. That we have truly a moral moment in America, like it was back in 1965. If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us, I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before because we…']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door, and it’s gotten worse and worse, and we now know why. As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, “Keep pumping them out, they’re eating them like Doritos.”']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' What we’ve got right now, though, George Stephanopoulos, it’s not a focused tariff on steel. What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies. He has put us in the middle of this trade war, and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.']"
BOOKER,"[' And so that’s what’s on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the Vice President. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week, I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.']"
CASTRO,"[' Well, I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I’m even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work. But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio was losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy. I was in Newton, Iowa a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They’re putting hundreds of people to work in decent paying jobs and creating a better future for those families. On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like…']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela, so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future. In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair. I’ll tell you what I believe in, in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.']"
SANDERS,"[' Yeah, but Americans don’t want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee healthcare to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don’t pay out-of-pocket and you don’t pay premiums, maybe you’ve run into people love their premiums, I haven’t. What people want is cost-effective healthcare, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her healthcare.']"
BIDEN,"[' Yeah, well, look, we’re either going to make a policy or China is going to make the trade, the rules of the road. We make up 25% of the world economy. We need another 25% to join us. And I think Elizabeth Warren’s correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is China, the problem isn’t the trade deficit; the problem is they’re stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they’re violating the WTO. They’re dumping steel on us. That’s a different issue than whether or not they’re dumping agricultural products on us. In addition to that, we’re in a position where if we don’t set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that’s why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.']"
GABBARD,"[' As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things', ' Ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve. And I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al-Qaeda in Syria who’ve been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.']"
STEYER,"[' What I’ve done is to try to push power down to the America people, to take power away from the corporations who’ve bought our government. And I’m talking now about structural reform in Washington DC. Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, you’re going to have to have new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Joe Biden won’t. Bernie Sanders won’t. Even Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. It’s time to push the power back to the people and away from DC.']"
BIDEN,"[' I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' And it is an issue for union jobs. And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that’s promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers. And then he hasn’t followed through. He has done nothing. He blew up a meeting at the White House. I would put $1 trillion into this, and I would pay for it by, first of all, changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer, as he promised. And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won’t have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood, that was African-American neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms. And I truly believe that if we’re gonna move on infrastructure and climate change, you need a voice from the heartland.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Thank you, Dana Bash, and I was just in Flint and they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous. So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan, and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. It’s a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams. I think the governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, “Fix the damn roads.”']"
BIDEN,"[' It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time… And I spent thousands of hours in the situation room. I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq. And guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lock-down conversation with Erdoğan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now, pay that price.']"
GABBARD,"[' Well, first of all we’ve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we’ve been waging in Syria. Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war. Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia, completely despicable.']"
STEYER,"[' I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.']"
BIDEN,"[' No, it wasn’t wrong to pull out, but I want to answer the Afghanistan question. I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service, but I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this… And it’s an open secret. You reported a long time ago, George Stephanopoulos, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that we’re going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. It’s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties… The three provinces in the east. They’re not any part of it, the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on, but here’s the point. The point is that it’s a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We don’t need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford’s a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we’ve had for eight years.']"
SANDERS,"[' George Stephanopoulos, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So, if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is the way to go.']"
SANDERS,"[' I believe that United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement. I happen to believe also that what, for me, democratic socialism means is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge, not in the media and not in Congress. You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You’ve got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies and in the media. Maybe, just maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1%. That’s my understanding of democratic socialism.']"
CASTRO,"[' Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day, talking about what we’re going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, actually, in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Thank you. This is the existential crisis of our time. It’s… You know that movie, The Day After Tomorrow? It’s today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. We’re seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West. And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done. On day one, I will get us back into the International Climate Change Agreement. On day two, I will bring back the Clean Power rules that President Obama had worked on. On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good. On day four, five and six, I will, working with Congress and mayors and business people all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal. And on day seven, you’re supposed to rest, but I won’t.']"
BOOKER,"[' And let me tell you, because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it’s… The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place, and that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That’s the first way, and you can with a two cents per milligram tax, bring in the money plus with the Federal Master Settlement to help in rural areas where they’re so isolated and also in urban areas where it’s, by the way, not just opioids, there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues.']"
YANG,"[' I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business. And I’m going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know, you’re going to do it. And then you don’t have a choice, you put your heart and soul into it. And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall. Lost investors hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer, guess it was a little easier. So, I remember lying on my floor looking up, wondering how it had to come to this. Eventually, I picked myself back up, I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years, and eventually had some success.']"
YANG,"[' The best way we can fight back… The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say, our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost, it went to Facebook, Amazon, Google, if we say, this is our property and we share in the gains, that’s the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.']"
WARREN,"[' We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies and what they’ve done is, they’ve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system, and they force people to have to fight to try to get the health care coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. Why does everybody, why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms? It’s because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no, and to push that cost back on the patients. That’s what we have to…']"
OROURKE,"[' You have some, Governor Bullock who said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right, who are talking about taking away people’s choice for the private insurance they have, or members of unions. I was listening to Dee Taylor…']"
WARREN,"[' I have proposed a wealth tax, it’s now time to do that. It’s time to tax the top 1/10th of 1% of fortunes in this country. Your first $50 million you can keep free and clear, but your 50 millionth and first dollar, you gotta pitch in $0.02. Two cents. What can America do with $0.02? We can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country aged zero to five. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. We can provide universal tuition-free college. We can expand Pell. We can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America. It tells you how badly broken this economy is…']"
BOOKER,"[' I joined together and led in the United States Senate, the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this President, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail. If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn’t make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people. And I challenge you, don’t just say big statements, back it up with details of the people in prison right now, looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.']"
WARREN,"[' So look, let’s be clear about this. We are the Democrats. We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. That’s what the Republicans are trying to do.']"
OROURKE,"[' I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority, and we turned around the VA in El Paso. We took that lesson nationally, and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing, Donald Trump. To show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first before party, before any other concern.']"
WARREN,"[' Look, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing. There’s gonna be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country, and no one wants to talk about. What you wanna do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, “Oh we don’t really have to do anything.” That’s the problem we’ve got in Washington right now. It continues to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change.']"
YANG,"[' So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities, so our people have a fighting chance to get well. Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem. And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they’re not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is after you save someone who’s OD’ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week. So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.']"
YANG,"[' As commander-in-chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century. And what are those threats? Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors. And if you look up, we’re in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now, because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not. We are 24 years behind on technology. And I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. Think about that timing. I guess they thought they’d invented everything. The next commander-in-chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow. And that’s what I will bring to the table as commander-in-chief.']"
YANG,"[' I’m here with my wife Evelyn tonight. We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian. How many of you all are parents like us here in the room? So if you are a parent you’ve had this thought, maybe you’ve been afraid to express it, and it is this. Our kids are not alright, they’re not alright because we’re leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents. We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, he is not, he is a symptom, and we need to cure the disease. Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States, because I am not insane. My first move was to go to DC talk to our leaders and say, “Technology is ripping us apart, immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind and the American Dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes.”']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I want to respond to Andrew Yang. I don’t see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponents, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election. This wasn’t meddling. That’s what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she’s doing. Sorry.']"
BOOKER,"[' So, yes, we will call China out for its human rights violations. But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights, because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It’s a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I’d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn’t make America great again. It makes Russia great again, and that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers’ issues, whether it is farmers’ issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' So if we want to get something done, and I personally think we should start with a voluntary buy-back program. That’s what I think, David. But I want to finish this because if you want action now, if you want action now, we’ve got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can’t wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.']"
CASTRO,"[' Well, I mean, you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is we’ve got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again. I also want people to think, the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free, to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill… As I said. Let’s be clear', ' Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone, we’re going to do better than the Canadians, though, and that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills, but I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up, they’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.']"
SANDERS,"[' But we must do more, we must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. And as president, I am prepared to take them on. Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right, not a privilege. And yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.']"
BIDEN,"[' If you eliminated the entire Pentagon. Every single thing. Plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you… It would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?']"
BIDEN,"[' No, what I said was, the question… Speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say… By the way, you can’t own the following weapons, period. They cannot be sold anymore, check with constitutional scholars. Now, you can say…']"
STEYER,"[' Rachel, I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me. Joe Biden won’t say it, Elizabeth Warren won’t say it. It’s a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency. I know that we have to do this. I’ve spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this. I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low income black and brown communities. And when we ask how are we going to pull this country together, how about this? We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.']"
GABBARD,"[' This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it’s unfortunate to see how in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others. But when she said abortion should be safe, legal and rare, I think she’s correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you’re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place as we’ve seen them as they’re passed in other countries where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point. I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I would say there is the will to change this in Congress. What’s missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants don’t diminish America, they are America. And if you wanna do something about border security, you first of all, change the rules so people can seek asylum in those northern triangle countries. Then you pass the bill and what the bill will do is it’ll rightly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for border help processing the cases. And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship because this is not just about the border.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Yes, this isn’t just about a system, or it’s not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland, because I’ve been a leader on these issues and have the will to close the boyfriend loophole. And I watched and wrote down when, nine times, he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA, and he folds. As your president, I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when that six little… Little six-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said, “He’s only six years old.” all I can say…']"
STEYER,"[' Look, I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society, and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels, and we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago. If we’re waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills, and I know everybody on this stage cares about this, but Congress has never passed an important climate bill, ever.']"
GABBARD,"[' Thank you. Now, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with Aloha. It’s not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters, we are all God’s children. So I’ve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues, we’ve developed a friendship that’s based on respect and he’s been there for me during some personally challenging times. The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided, Donald Trump must be defeated.']"
BIDEN,"[' Because it got done before. I’m the only one up here who’s ever beat the NRA. Only one ever beat the NRA nationally. I’m the guy that brought the Brady Bill into focus and became law. And so that’s number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened. It went from a cause to a movement. Look what’s happened now, mothers, their organization, Mothers Against Gun Violence. We’ve seen what’s happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the President had over 50% of members of the NRA supporting them and, overwhelmingly, the rest of the people supporting them. Now, the numbers are much higher because they realize what I’ve been saying, and we’ve all been saying, is correct, over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period, and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements. So the point is, things have changed and things have changed a lot. And now what’s happening is… And by the way, the way Beto handles… Excuse me for saying, Beto, Congressman…']"
BIDEN,"[' Well, the Senator said… She’s being vague on the issue of… Actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No. Look. Look, here’s the deal, it’s… Come on, it cost $30 trillion. Guess what? That’s over $3 trillion a year. If we… It’s more than the entire federal budget. Let me finish, okay?']"
SANDERS,"[' Let me be blunt and tell you what you don’t hear much about in Congress, or in the media, and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country.']"
SANDERS,"[' Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, we’re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.']"
CASTRO,"[' He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria. And just to connect the dots for a second, if you’re Kim Jong-un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran’s nuclear weapons program, and now he’s abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I so appreciate what the Congressman’s been doing. And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage. And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds, one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasn’t enough to save those people. That’s what unites us. You know what else unites us? And I’ll tell you this. What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell’s desk, are three bills', ' Universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don’t get Amy Klobuchar-47s.']"
BOOKER,"[' Well, first of all, this is a president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact, attacking them as well. We used a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. And so, at the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies. We would need to show strength against China.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' We can do two things at once. That’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests. He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He has not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa, and I take this even a step further. When he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent. That’s illegal conduct. That’s what he was doing. He didn’t talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that. So I’m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' We need to work with our allies to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here, and I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it, and now he’s too proud to say it, and what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say, “Come back, Turkey, and stop this.” Because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mid-East. Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement, and leaves them holding the bag, and gives the power to China and Russia.']"
YANG,"[' Well, first, we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it.']"
YANG,"[' Well, first, I just want to stick up for Tom. We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change. And you can’t knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion.']"
YANG,"[' That’s exactly right, and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.']"
WARREN,"[' We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism. The way we do better is to fight back and show something better. So I have a plan, for example, on education, that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we’ve got to acknowledge what’s happened on race. So my plan has universal, tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.']"
OROURKE,"[' I’ve listened to the sciences on this and they’re very clear. We don’t have more than 10 years to get this right. And we won’t meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We’ve gotta bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge, they want those jobs, they wanna create the future for this country and the world. Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country. And those farmers in Iowa say, “Pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements.” That’s how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone into the solution.']"
BOOKER,"["" So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans, 83% of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It’s one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It’s why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I’m happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing. But this is what I’m sorry about. I’m sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.""]"
BOOKER,"[' The only people, though, who actually buy into this president’s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don’t know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved, local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him. In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow, and it’s why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America, includes Community Renewal Visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting… Not only for jobs, but for population, to embrace immigration, as we have in my city.']"
WARREN,"[' Now, I wanna have a chance to tell the story about my friend Eddie Barkin. Eddie is 35 years old, he has a wife, Rachel. He has a cute little boy named Carl. He also has ALS and it’s killing him. Eddie has health insurance, good health insurance…']"
WARREN,"[' Now, that didn’t happen, and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. We took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand', ' It’s about the next president, and the next president, and the next president and the future of this country.']"
OROURKE,"[' How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed? It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access, and, increasingly, outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president, we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office. We will listen to people, not PAnderson Coopers, people, not corporations, people, not special interests. It’s not…']"
WARREN,"[' So climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create. So I’ve proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say, anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest. And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world. Right now, for every $1 the United States spends trying to market around the world, China’s spending $100.']"
YANG,"[' And the people in Washington DC had nothing for this. They don’t want to touch it, they don’t want to talk about an issue they don’t think they have a solution for. I’m not running for president because I’ve fantasized about being president, I’m running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight, I’m a parent and a patriot, and I have seen the future that we’re leaving for our kids, and it is not something I’m willing to accept. We need to create a new way forward for our people. If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to yang2020.com and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them, and believe it, “Your country loves you, your country values you, and you will be alright.”']"
YANG,[' We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that trade-off and say if they leave the home and work they’re going to be spending all the money on child care anyway; in many cases it would be better if the parent stays home with the child.']
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth’s work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we’ve had so many times, is that we don’t talk about the things that I’m hearing about from regular Americans, that is longterm care. We are seeing, I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative. So I call it the silver surge, the aging of the population. We need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addiction that they have caused and the people that they have killed.']"
BOOKER,"[' Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it is just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong. I wanted to return back to this issue of Black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with Black voters; I’ve been one since I was 18.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I’m talking about building up alliances, and if your question is about experience, let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have, in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not, since it wasn’t accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our election. So to protect ourself in 2020, what we need', ' One, back-up paper ballots in every single state. That is the bill that I need and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening and then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That’s the Honest Ads Act. That’s a bipartisan bill that I lead and we can’t wait to…']"
CASTRO,"[' Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience. I grew up, like I bet a lot of folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV, I grew up with my twin brother Joaquin in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us, and also her mom, my grandmother, and we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month. Or sometimes have the electricity turned off. And when I was a kid to look at the grocery lists that seemed to get shorter and shorter. And that’s what’s happening to a lot of families these days.']"
SANDERS,"[' Trump is a pathological liar. I tell the truth. We have been in Afghanistan, I think 18 years, in Iraq 16 or 17 years. We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror, and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began. We’re gonna spend the Congress’s past and I will not vote for a $715 billion military budget, more than the 10 next countries combined. What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts like people sitting at a table, not by killing each other. As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the UN, but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world, to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully. The United States cannot be the policemen of the world.']"
SANDERS,"[' Guess what? You’re guessing. Alright, and here’s the answer. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can’t work two or three jobs to support themselves, which is why under my legislation, we’ll move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year. What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt-free. And what we will also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong, except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.']"
GABBARD,"[' I’m glad you asked, because I was going to say it’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape. But here’s the real question I believe you should be asking is', ' Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like.']"
STEYER,"[' More than double. So for us to win, for everybody on this stage, for whoever is the candidate, to have a Senate that’s democratic, for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely…']"
BIDEN,"[' What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous. Number one, we didn’t lock people up in cages, we didn’t separate families, we didn’t do all of those things, number one. Number two, by the time… This is the president who came along with the DAnderson CooperA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president who sent a legislation to desk, saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is the president who has done a great deal. So I’m proud to have served with him.']"
CASTRO,"[' While I’m not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates, Jake Tapper, I was called a street fighter from the Iron Range by my opponent, and when she said it, I said, “Thank you.” So this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That’s what Barack Obama wanted. And it would bring health care costs down for everyone. And by the way, I just don’t buy this. I’ve heard some of these candidates say that it’s somehow not moral, if you… Not moral to not have that public option. Well Bernie Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year, and that was, Bernie, the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced. Clearly this is the easiest way to move forward quickly. And I wanna get things done. People can’t wait. I’ve got… My friend, Nicole, out there who’s son who has actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager, and he died because he didn’t have enough money to pay for it.']"
CASTRO,"[' I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about. In a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools. And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life, to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and healthcare opportunities, and those things that truly, truly ensure that the entire family can prosper. Those are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools, they’re not and so…']"
BIDEN,"[' What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would, in fact, make sure that there is… We immediately surge to the border. All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard, that’s who we are. We’re a nation that says, “If you want to flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come.” I would change the order that the President just changed saying, “Women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.” And, by the way, retrospectively, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let’s put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act now for them to go back.']"
GABBARD,"[' Yeah, absolutely. So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having US troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the US actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria like Al-Qaeda, HTom Steyer, al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war. That’s really what you’re saying.']"
STEYER,"[' Well, I agree with exactly what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we’re going to win in 2020. I don’t mean to change the subject, but I think it’s sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that’s going to mean is turnout. In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don’t vote at all, because they think neither party tells the truth. “No one deals with my issues. The system is broken. Why would we vote?” But what we’ve found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at 2018 and flipping the house, what really happened was democratic voting went up by three quarters; in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than a 100%.']"
SANDERS,"[' Resilience, to me, means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George Stephanopoulos, running for US Senate in Vermont, getting 1% of the vote; running for Governor and getting 2% of the vote. Finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont with 10-vote margin. What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry, whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. And I feel confident that given a life-long record, I’ve taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us, not just the 1%.']"

I’m running to transform this country, and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated. Two days ago I had a remarkable experience, which should tell you everything you need to know about what’s going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit, a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today. But it’s not just the price-fixing, and the corruption, and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. It’s what’s going on in the fossil fuel industry, it’s what’s going on in Wall Street, it’s what’s going on with the prison industrial complex. We need a mass political movement.

And just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country. I’m not only running to defeat Donald Trump, I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I’m looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting. Thirty seconds, nine people killed. The public is with us on this, in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk, the background check bill. My bill to close the boyfriend loop holes so domestic abusers don’t get guns. The bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That’s what we should be focusing on, and I just don’t want to screw this up. When I’m president, I do want to bring in in an assault weapon ban. And I do want to put a limitation on magazine so what happened in Dayton, Ohio will never happen again, but let’s not mess this up with this fight.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires, not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.']"
BOOKER,"[' Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off and they’re worried. They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they’re worried because the Democratic Party, we don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn’t… Isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection.']"
YANG,"[' And second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression. The American people would back me on this. We know that they have found an underbelly and they’ve been clawing at it, and it’s made it so that we can’t even trust our own democracy.']"
WARREN,"[' I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for President of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for. I don’t get it. Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption. It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat, and we need to have the courage to fight back against that. And until we’re ready to do that, it’s just more of the same. Well, I’m ready to get in this fight, I’m ready to win this fight.']"
OROURKE,"[' I do, because in my administration after we have waived citizenship fees for Green Card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans, freed dreamers from any fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge. End for-profit detention in this country, and then assist those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2,000 mile journey. Then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.']"
WARREN,"[' Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller Report came out, I read it', ' All 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so, at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.']"
WARREN,"[' So, giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more, middle class families are going to pay less out-of-pocket for their healthcare. And I’d like to finish talking about Eddie, the guy who has ALS. This isn’t funny. This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying. And every month he has about $9000 in medical bills that his insurance company won’t cover. His wife Rachel is on phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company, please cover what the doctors say he needs. He talks about what it’s like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family, and strangers for money, so he can cover his medical expenses. The basic profit model of an insurance company is take in as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in healthcare coverage. That is not working for Americans…']"
BOOKER,"[' You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can’t get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I’m looking to lead a movement. The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry. Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the Revolutionary War till now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me. That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims… We have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency, because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.']"
HARRIS,"[' Look, there is a lot at stake in this election, and I’ve said it many times, I think justice is on the ballot in 2020, and it’s about economic justice, it’s about justice for children, it’s about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list. And so the issue really is not what is the fight, the issue has to be how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that’s the last time we won. And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together, around our commonalities of which I believe there are many.']"
HARRIS,"[' And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States, and I look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings, and I see these little girls and boys, sometimes even brought by their fathers, and they bring them to me, and I talk to them during these events, and they smile and they’re full of joy, and their fathers tell them, “See, don’t you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be. You have to believe in what can be, unburdened by what has been.”']"
WARREN,"[' You asked about a surprising friend, for me it would be Charles Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Stephanopoulos Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican. And we didn’t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle-class. And Charles engaged with it over and over, and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.']"
WARREN,"[' I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. I’m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party, I’m not here to try to build fences, but I am here to say this is what I will fight for as president of the United States. The women of America can count on me.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' I don’t care how old you are, I care about your vision. But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world. Leaders like the… I actually think it’s good that the Prime Minister of New Zealand’s gotten a lot of attention in democratic debate. She’s masterful, she is younger than I would be when I take office. This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following. But only if it’s actually backed by the right vision. And we can have great presidents at any age. What I will say is, we need the kind of vision that’s gonna win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn’t work. We have to be ready to take on this president. And by the way, something that hasn’t been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress. When David Duke…']"
BOOKER,"[' Well, first of all, I’m happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, said, “I am having deja vu all over again.” I’m having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016’s election. We are literally using Donald Trump’s lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves and the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we’re distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics. To look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win and not just win the presidency, but take back the US Senate is by winning big and the way we win big, is with that fired-up Democratic base that’s out there today. But it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this and I ask you to join me because I’ve done it before and I will do it again. Amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.']"
BOOKER,"[' So first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals, like Mattis, who said on the world stage, “The United States of America. There can be no better friend than the United States of America, and no greater enemy than the United States of America.” This president has turned that upside down, and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances, and partner with Russia. And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine and Latvia and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.']"
BOOKER,"[' Well, first of all, let’s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They’re not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country', ' Liberty, the ability to control your own body. But they are particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty. Because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country, it is an insult on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body. And so, the way as president of the United States I’m going to deal with this is first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that’s gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade. I will fight to codify it and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I want us to remember that this election is yes, an economic check on this president. And I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the cost of healthcare, yes. But this is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. And when you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn’t vote in 2016. African-Americans are turning out like we didn’t see before. But we also, and they must be with us, and we must get our fired up Democratic base with us. But we also… Let’s get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore.']"
OROURKE,"[' Yeah. We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road. The kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we the people have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits. Right now we treat them functionally as a utility, when in reality, they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see, our pictures and personal information that they share with others. We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing. To publish that ad that Elizabeth Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president. Treat them like the publisher that they are, that’s what I will do as president. And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don’t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That’s something that Donald Trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It’s not something that we should do. So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy and data and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.']"
SANDERS,"[' But I think at the end of the day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin, or where we were born, or our sexual orientation, or our religion. And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1%. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.']"
SANDERS,"[' You talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency, I’ve introduced legislation to just do that. Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question. You asked your question and said, “What are we going to do in decades?” We don’t have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don’t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we’re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going under water. We’re talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances. The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come, there are going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees, causing national security issues all over the world.']"
OROURKE,"[' Look, we’re going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it’s not right. And as president, I would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and Amy Klobuchar-47s. Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country. So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and Amy Klobuchar-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror. Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them, more than 80% feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican-Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president’s racism and hatred that he’s directed at communities like mine in El Paso.']"
BIDEN,"[' Okay, number one, my healthcare plan does significantly cut the cost. The largest out-of-pocket payment you’ll pay is $1,000. You’ll be able to get into a… Anyone who can’t afford it, gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, etcetera. But guess what, of the 160 million people who like their healthcare now, they can keep it. If they don’t like it, they can leave. Number one.']"
OROURKE,"[' Yes, we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it. We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050, that we are halfway there by 2030, that we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that, that we invest here in Houston, Texas with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding. Given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you’d like to think you’re good for 1500 years, but you’re not. They’re coming faster, and larger, and more devastating than ever.']"
BIDEN,"[' I’m so tired of everybody walking around like, “Woe is me. What are we going to do?” Let’s remember, this is the United States of America. There has never, ever, ever been a time when we set our mind to do something, we’ve been unable to do it. Never. Never, never. So it’s time to remember the word, get up! Let’s take back this country and lead the world again, it’s within our power to do it. Get up and take it back!']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' We have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate, if and only if, we win the presidency. If and only if we beat Donald Trump. Nominate me and you get to see the President of the United States stand next to an American war veteran, and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve. Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks you’re a sucker, when the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing, or the cost of education.']"
BIDEN,"[' Distinction; should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That’s one question. He’s very close to impe… He’s indicted himself. Number two, after he’s thrown out of office, or after he’s defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That’s a judgment to be made by an attorney general.']"
STEYER,"[' But I also want to point out that Anderson’s right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding, they’re the voice that counts and that’s who I went to, the American people.']"
BIDEN,"[' Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It’s the number one issue, and I might add, I don’t really need kind of a lecture from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game changer, while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we’ve ever done it, my friend was producing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces. Now, I welcome him back into the fold here, and he’s been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let’s get this straight, I think it is the existential threat of all time.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Still the conversation that we’ve been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money out of politics. But when I propose the actual structural Democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the constitution, if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have DC actually be a state, and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform. Does anybody really think we’re gonna overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its constitution so you couldn’t drink, and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.']"
OROURKE,"[' We’re also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that. And then we’re going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil. That’s the way that we’re going to meet this challenge, and we’re going to bring everyone into the solution.']"
SANDERS,"[' What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied, when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet, and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well.']"
BIDEN,"[' Number two, the fact of the matter is, we’re in a situation where if you noticed he hadn’t answered the question, this is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let’s have a big idea. The tax of 2% the Senator’s talking about, that raises about $3 billion. Guess what, that leaves you about $28 billion short. The Senator said, before it’s going to cost you in your pay… There will be a deductible in your paycheck. You’re going to… The middle class person… Someone making 60 grand with three kids, they’re going to end up paying $5,000 more, they’re going to end up paying 4% more on their income tax. That’s a reality. Now, it’s not a bad idea if you like it. I don’t like it.']"
OROURKE,"[' So, I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don’t go door-to-door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike…']"
OROURKE,[' Talking about this progressive agenda and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won. That’s the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020.']
SANDERS,"[' Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what, we’re going to lose the election. Right now, you got 87 million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We are facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump’s corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country, we also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires and that our economy is rigged, with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.']"
BOOKER,"[' But I’ll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test, the spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history, rugged individualism didn’t get us to the moon, it didn’t beat the Nazis, it didn’t map the human genome, it didn’t beat Jim Crow, everything we did in this country big and, Vice President, we have done so many big things, the fact that there’s an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' This is how we build a coalition, so we don’t just beat Donald Trump, we bring the US Senate to some sense, we send Mitch McConnell packing, this is how we win. So if you want to join us, and remember that this won’t be for me a personal victory, it’ll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time. If you want to join us, and if you believe that our work doesn’t end on election day, but begins on inauguration day, join us, amyklobuchar.com, thank you.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' This is a pattern with this man and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does. And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that’s going to put our country first. So, I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this, “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States.']"
BOOKER,"[' Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he’s going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he’s now given them a foothold again. This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he’s bringing our troops home. At the same time, he’s increasing troop presence with the Saudis while they’re involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen. This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. As president of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' When David Duke ran for Congress… Ran for governor, the Republican Party, 20 years ago, ran away from him. Today they are supporting naked racism in the White House, or at best silent about it. And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that, when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story, of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether, in this moment, with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.']"
BOOKER,"[' And I’m having deja vu all over again. I’m having deja vu all over again, ’cause we have another healthcare debate. And we’re not talking about the clear and existential threat in America, that we’re in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women’s reproductive rights under attack, and God bless Kamala. But you know what women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.']"
WARREN,"[' I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this, when someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It’s just going to fall hard on poor women. It’s going to fall hard on girls, women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance, and I know it could be a hard decision for people, but here’s the thing, when it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother, she should be able to call on her partner, she should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi, but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.']"
WARREN,"[' Now, people who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police, or paid less because of the color of their skin, are in a fight today. And anyone who doesn’t understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who’s likely to win them. For me this is about knowing what’s broken, knowing how to fix it. And yes, I’m willing to get out there and fight for it.']"
HARRIS,"[' But this is a critical point, if a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade, they are 13% more likely to go to college. If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade, they are 32% more likely to go to college. So when we talk about investing in our public education system, it is at the source of so much. When we fix it, that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the potential of our children.']"
HARRIS,"[' And I’m running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks, and we’ve got to recreate the Obama coalition to win, and that means about women, that’s people of color, that’s our LSteve BullockTQ community, that’s working people, that’s our labor unions, but that is how we are going to win this election, and I intend to win.']"
HARRIS,"[' Well, it’s just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it’s shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, “Listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.” During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He’s been selling out working people, he’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers, then, rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.']"
WARREN,"[' So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we’re willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Kamala Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out, 20 years out, Whites who borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African-Americans have paid it off. I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness, it will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let’s do something tangible and real to make change in this country.']"
WARREN,"[' And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.']"
WARREN,"[' So, understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Yes. Look, around the world, we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe. But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan, when I thought I was turning out the lights, years ago. Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like. To hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague. We’re pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan, who was not born on 9/11.']"
BOOKER,"[' Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats. And I don’t agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it. But I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue. But here’s the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well. When I stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs, half the church raised their hands.']"

BUTTIGIEG,"[' And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated, and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what’s worth more to you than winning. And I think that’s what we need in the presidency right now, we have to know what we are about. And this election is not about any of us up here, it is not about this President, even though it’s hard to talk of anything else some days. It’s about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we’re actually going to make their schools safe when they’ve learned active shooter drills before they’ve learned to read. A generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change. And if we hold to that, then it doesn’t matter what happens to each of us professionally, together we will win a better era for our country.']"

They can join immediately. And we’re talking four, six, eight, 10 years depending on who you talk about before we get to Medicare for All. Come on, I’ve been there. You’ve been there. You know what it’s like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.']"
SANDERS,"[' I think Joe is right; I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he’s above the law; we have a president who has engaged in corruption; we have a president who has obstructed justice, and in my view somebody who has violated the emoluments clause. I think Joe is right; that is the function of an independent Department of Justice, but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.']"
SANDERS,"[' Alright? The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71% of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we’ve got to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we’re going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren. The way you win an election, in this time in history, is not the same old same old. You have to inspire people, you have to excite people. You’ve got to bring working people, and young people, and poor people into the political process.']"
OROURKE,"[' By the end of that trip not only had we formed a friendship but we had formed trust, we worked with each other on each other’s bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue. And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat, we won independents and Republicans in record numbers as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.']"
STEYER,"[' As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise, 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it’d be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants, healthcare, education, Green New Deal or minimum wage unless we break the power of these corporations.']"
STEYER,"[' Well, first of all, let me say this. Bernie Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Bernie Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong, it’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.']"
SANDERS,"[' Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies, and tell them that the function of healthcare is to guarantee care to all people, not to make a $100 billion in profit.']"
OROURKE,"[' I’ve always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences. I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas. Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community. As a member of Congress I remember being in San Antonio, I was visiting the VA there March of 2017, I found that my flight had been snowed in in Washington, DC. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd, and on a whim I said, “Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?” And he called my bluff, we got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot, it was spring break, drove 1600 miles across the country, live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.']"
BIDEN,"[' Alright. Two points. You’ve got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you’ve got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they’re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer and our program is the only one that does that.']"
OROURKE,"[' This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis and we’ve got to do something about it. And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I’m describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks and Red Flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war. But to use the analogy of healthcare, it would be as though we said, “Look, we’re for primary care but let’s not talk about mental healthcare ’cause that’s a bridge too far. People need that primary care now. So let’s save that for another day.” No, let’s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let’s bring this country together in order to do that.

SANDERS,"[' Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying, nobody is above the law. And I think what the American people are also saying is, in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law. But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote, that somebody raised here, was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that. I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, the majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.']"

BUTTIGIEG,"[' You know, as a military officer serving under, don’t ask, don’t tell and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was Governor, at a certain point when it came to professional setbacks, I’d wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback. I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially ’cause inconveniently, it was an election year in my socially conservative community. What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80% of the vote.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Thank you. Well, I just… I’m someone that doesn’t come from money, and I appreciate the work of Tom Steyer. But right now, we have a system that’s not fair, and it’s not just fair for money. And so what I would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn Citizens United. That’s what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics. I have led the way on voting. And I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be to allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.']"
BOOKER,"[' This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office, it’s a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women. And love is not sentimentality, it’s not anemic, love is struggle, love is sacrifice, love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we’re ever going to make it as a nation we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' If we wanna start wiping away student debt, here’s where I would start. I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way. The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they delivered results. President Trump, under a secretary of education, who regrettably is from this state, did away with those rules. There’s no accountability. On my watch, those colleges that turned the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that’s where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.']"
WARREN,"[' So I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive. Look, I don’t have a beef with billionaires. My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. And all I’m saying is, you make it to the top, the top one tenth of 1%, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.']"

WARREN,"[' If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity. Now, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border, I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There’s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys.']"
HARRIS,"[' But the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight, he has given us the evidence, and he tried to cover it up putting it in that special server. And there’s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.']"
HARRIS,"[' That’s a great question, Anderson, because the Commander in Chief of the United States of America has, as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities, to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security in hotspots around the world. What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS. And let’s be clear, what Donald Trump has done because of that phone call with Erdoğan is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four', ' Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS. This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s making, and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump’s making. And that’s why dude got to go, and when I am Commander in Chief, we will stop this madness.']"
WARREN,"[' So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, “Don’t even try because you will never get it passed.” And sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us, but we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.']"
WARREN,"[' Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing. Also private developers, they’ve gone up to McMansions. They’re not building the little two-bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers. So, I’ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It’s about tenants’ rights.']"
WARREN,"[' It is an honor to be here, to be in this fight, I know what’s broken, I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done, that includes everyone.']"
HARRIS,"[' My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us. I have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation of federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap, which is $13,500 a year. Because right now in our public schools, our teachers, 94% of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. And that is wrong. I also want to talk about where we are here at Tom SteyerU and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have as part of my proposal that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers, because one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university, I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions. But also…']"
BOOKER,"[' So, look, this president has broken norms, as you’ve said. He used his platforms to demean, degrade, and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation. So, absolutely, in that office I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it’s not for a Kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. I’m glad you offered up that analogy to healthcare, because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority. To actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire…']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm’s way, fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I’ll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people, because as was just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and child care. We must do this, and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big. But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I am going to pay for them, meticulously; I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now who has told over 10,000 lies. So when you look at my website, at AmyKlobuchar.com, you will see my plans, and you’re also going to see how I’m going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day. So yes, my plan is three months. I think that’s good. I’d love to do more.']"
BOOKER,"[' First of all I just want to respond by… We’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters. I’ve had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me, is unacceptable. I have seen this script before, it didn’t work in 2016.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. I’m not saying that I became mayor and racism or poverty ended on my watch. But in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges, like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested African-American neighborhood. Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the Board of Safety that handles police matters.']"
SANDERS,"[' Second of all… Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare but our job is to run a nonprofit healthcare system. Furthermore, furthermore, when we save 500 billion dollars a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy trying to deal with the health insurance company hospitals will be better off…']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, let me just say this. One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it. And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War as well. And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don’t have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined. But to answer your question, yeah, I think it is time… After spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home.']"
OROURKE,"[' Yes, we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world’s greatest democracy, and being able to do it, thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so, that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward. But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked. How do we stand up to Russia on the global stage? We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn’t enough money in this country. There aren’t enough service members as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world, and the Kurds are a case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS, not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there.']"
BIDEN,"[' That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on healthcare. I know that the Senator says she’s for Bernie. Well, I’m for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that’s been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one. Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for healthcare costs a lot of money, it costs $740 billion, it doesn’t cost $30 trillion, 3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is, that’s before it exists now, without interest on the debt.']"
SANDERS,"[' When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured, when you got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt. And then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage. And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years. So if you’re asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying… The wealthiest, top one-tenth of 1% start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us, yes, that’s exactly what I believe.']"
STEYER,"[' The reason I’m running for president is that we have a broken government, and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It’s about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It’s about the gun manufacturers buying the government and getting what they want. We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I’ve put forward actual structural changes including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote. These corporations have taken over our government and 72,000 deaths last year are the tragic result.']"
STEYER,"[' Look, I agree with Elizabeth Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that’s part of it. But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He’s going to be saying he’s the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch, one room, no employers, and built a multi-billion dollar international business. We’re going to have to show the American people that we don’t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies, but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector. In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a business person, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan’s a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show them in fact he’s failed the American people and he has to go.']"
SANDERS,"[' Let me… I’m more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let’s take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic. You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it’s not just the drug companies; right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.']"
SANDERS,"[' But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at three o’clock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community. And if it’s necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course, we will do that. But at the end of the day, we have to rethink the entire war on terror which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region as well.']"
BIDEN,"[' How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that’s happening. Thus far, my distinguished friend, the Senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it. And the Senator has in fact come forward and said how he’s going to pay for it, but he gets about halfway there. There’s a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are Title 1 schools from $15 to $45 billion a year. But I go down the line and each of the things we’re talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done and why it’s better.']"
OROURKE,"[' And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, “We have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration.” We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals. Not on the backs of 18 and 19 and 20-year-olds anymore, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.']"
SANDERS,"[' We’ll have strong border protections. But the main point I wanna make is that what Trump is doing, through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as President, I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view they are not criminals.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' This happened in my community, 20 years before I was born, and when I was growing up, we were still picking up the pieces. Empty factories, empty houses, poverty. I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place, and there will be more. It’s why we actually need to put the interests of workers first. Of course, we need to do retraining, we’re doing it now in South Bend, we should continue to do it. But this is so much bigger than a trade fight, this is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes. There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week than my parents went through in their lifetime. It’s why I’ve proposed that we allow gig workers to unionize, because a gig is a job, and a worker is a worker.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' As I’ve said before, I’d love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs. I just am not going to go for things… And this is not… I’m not talking about Kamala Harris’ plan here, but I’m talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just ’cause they sound good on a bumper sticker, and then throw in a free car. I think that we have an obligation; we have an obligation as a party to be, yes, fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but make sure we have people’s backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for. And that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don’t support, to kicking 149 million off their health insurance, current health insurance…']"
BOOKER,"[' And it will be disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren, I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there, but we’ve had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America, of child poverty. We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things, not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world. My plan will focus on that. And these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we’re against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are.']"
BOOKER,"[' So, absolutely, when I was mayor of the largest city in my state, and this is where I agree with Mayor Pete, mayoral experience is very important. And I happen to be the other Rhodes Scholar Mayor on this stage.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' Adult life. This is really important, okay? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we’re going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it’s, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your guns.” We have an opportunity to deliver healthcare to everybody.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' The nation was riveted this week by the testimony in Washington. One of the people we heard from yesterday was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. And what he said is, he spoke to his immigrant father, and he said, “In this country you can tell the truth and it’s going to be fine.” It reminded me of a Army counsel years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”']"
HARRIS,"[' I took on as the Attorney General of California, I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles 20 years ago you’ll remember that sky was brown, you go there now, the sky is blue and you know why? Because leader just decided to lead and we took on these big fossil fuel companies, we have some of the most important and strongest laws in the country and we made a difference and my point being, I’ve done it before and I will lead as President on this issue because we have no time, the clock is ticking, but we need courage and we need courageous leadership, we can get this done.']"
WARREN,"[' I grew up out in Oklahoma, I have three older brothers, they all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we’re divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together. We want to see all of our children get a good start in life, we don’t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare, we’re willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country, whether they’re Democrats, independents or Republicans, they know what’s broken, they know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top, and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country regardless of party are ready to say, no more. We want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history.']"
WARREN,"[' The top one tenth of 1% that I want to say, pay 2 cents more, they’ll pay 3.2% in America. I’m tired of free-loading billionaires. I think it’s time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets a real…']"
WARREN,"[' I think there are a number of options. I think as Pete Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them. But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America, where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal. What we’re talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country, three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you’ve got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.']"
HARRIS,"[' So when I think about this issue, I’m thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table after everyone’s gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee, trying to figure out how he’s going to make it work. And he’s probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he’s going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he’s going to miss his kids’ soccer games. That’s the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I pass… When I get elected and pass this bill which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that’s going to make a real difference in that man’s life. And don’t tell him that’s not a big deal when he’s trying to get through the end of the month.']"
HARRIS,"[' This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on women’s access to reproductive healthcare, which is under full-on attack in America today, and it’s outrageous.']"
HARRIS,"[' Because here’s the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don’t pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don’t pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I’m running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.']"
WARREN,"[' I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I’ve taken a pledge, anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador because I’m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, “We are not going to give away the ambassador posts to the highest bidder.”']"
WARREN,"[' But there’s one more piece. Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said, for black people, you’re cut out of the deal. That was known as red-lining. When I built a housing plan, it’s not only a housing plan about building new units. It’s a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government-sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it.']"
BOOKER,"[' I stood with these workers because we’re seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country. So the other thing that I’ll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers’ conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' And including all vice presidents being men. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that’s at home knows exactly what I mean. We have to work harder, and that’s a fact. But I want to dispel one thing, because for so long why has this been happening? I don’t think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels. And your answer was yes, the fact-checkers can check this out. But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what you’ve just pointed out, is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends, to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us. Leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev. Like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.']"
BOOKER,"[' Again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We’re all united in wanting to see universal preschool, and I’ll fight for that. We’re all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for two parents that went to HBCUs. But the tax the way we’re putting it forward, right now the wealth tax, I’m sorry it’s cumbersome. It’s been tried by other nations. It’s hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation. But again, we as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' That’d be great for us. And then the next day, there would be a student loan program, and people would be out taking student loans wondering why they weren’t lucky enough, in timing, to get theirs wiped away completely too. We can have debt-free college for low and middle-income students by expanding Pell Grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden. And on the back end, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now. We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair.']"
SANDERS,"[' When we talk about a rigged economy, it’s not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90% of what the American people see, hear or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger, which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country. We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price-fixing which we see every day.']"
OROURKE,"[' I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up, and sometimes I think that Elizabeth Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions. I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She’s working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we’re going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage. And Elizabeth Warren said, “Show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you’ll show me your values.” She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.']"
BIDEN,"[' I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America, there’s never been a single solitary time when we’ve set our mind to something and we’ve not able to do it. We’re walking around with our heads down like, “Woe is me.” We’re the best equipped nation in the world to take this on, it’s no longer time to postpone, we should get moving. There’s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.']"
SANDERS,"[' And I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say, “Get the government off our backs. We want small government.” Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.']"
BIDEN,"[' Folks, we are in a position where we have… We’re the wealthiest nation in the world, our workers are more productive than workers around the world, three times as productive as workers in Asia. We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined. We are in a position where we’ve led, not by the example of our power, but the power of our example.']"
STEYER,"[' We can’t solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves, it’s an international crisis. I’ve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations, but we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world. So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he’s been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we’re going to do, but specifically climate, we’re going to have to lead the world morally. We’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody, and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single light.']"
STEYER,"[' Absolutely. As far as I’m concerned, Mr. Trump’s America First program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it’s proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia’s attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies, makes absolutely no sense. Let’s go to the most important international problem that we’re facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate.']"
BIDEN,"[' I assume when we’re talking about the corruption of the federal government we weren’t talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration, made so much progress. But one thing we haven’t talked about here today, we’ve talked about everything, we haven’t talked about the one thing I think is most consequential. The American people are having an enormous opportunity, there’s incredible, incredible… I’ve never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career, and I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the United States Senate.']"
OROURKE,"[' Thank you, George Stephanopoulos. Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that. The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country, we don’t see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous, we see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security and to our safety. Yesterday I was visiting with one of those victims. He’s the head coach of the Fusion, this is a girls’ soccer team of 10 and 11-year-old girls.']"
SANDERS,"[' Amy mentioned that women feel strongly on it. Well, let me just tell you that if there’s ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment.']"
SANDERS,"[' Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We’re going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people. But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.']"
BUTTIGIEG,"[' We have to respond to all of these changes, and, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by doubling unionization, as I propose to do. Some of this is low-tech too, like the minimum wage is just too low, and so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage, when scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.']"
KLOBUCHAR,"[' I agree with what the Mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience, and of leading 11 of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to. And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I’ve got to the Senate, and I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill, to say, “Yeah, you have to say where these ads come from, and how they’re paid for.” And stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don’t have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill, and I am so close to getting it done, and the way I get it done is if I’m president. But just like I have won statewide… And Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official… And you did not, when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.']"
BOOKER,"[' If we as a country don’t start it, if we as a party don’t start talking not just about how to tax wealth, but how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream, because, yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But the people in communities I frequent, they’re not… Aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity. And that’s what our party has to be about, as well.']"
BOOKER,[' And then it is not just because women are daughters and our friends and our wives. It’s because women are people and people deserve to control their own body.']
KLOBUCHAR,"[' First of all, I’ve made it very clear I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage, and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard. Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can’t do, because it has all been men.']"
WARREN,"[' Yes. I think it should be. All three of my brothers served in the military, one was career military, the other two also served. I think it’s an important part of who we are as Americans, and I think the notion of shared service is important, it’s how we help bring our nation together. It’s how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It’s also about how family share that sacrifice. I remember what it was like when I was a little girl, my brother, my oldest brother who served five-and-a-half years off and on in combat in Vietnam, and what it was like for my mother every day to check to mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed? How is he doing? And if it was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if it wasn’t, she’d say, “Well, maybe tomorrow.” This is about building for our entire nation, and I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country, so for example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands, to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change.']"
WARREN,"[' So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks. You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $50 billion in assets, your first $50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, you’ve got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here’s the thing. Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It’s about saying, you built something great in this country? Good for you.']"
HARRIS,"[' I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama.']"
HARRIS,"[' There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die. Poor women, women of color, will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.']"
