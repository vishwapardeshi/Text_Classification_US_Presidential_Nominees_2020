test_62.txt,"Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the City Council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn’t think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it, and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, ’cause believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you can’t just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck. On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out. So one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job, and then I went and I voted against that land deal, on the City Council.",11,12,6,11,10,11

And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and I guess that’s why I’m running.

test_105.txt,"So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now, as a country? I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake is the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages.

Every single person deserves to be treated with respect regardless of race, religion, or gender or even your politics. Inclusion, unity, respect, aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration. Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the aloha spirit. He said, “We look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country. ” He later went on to say, “As I looked out at the various faces in various colors, mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.”",11,11,10,10,8,2

And lastly, to be commander-in-chief, there’s no time for on-the-job training. I’ve spent more time in the Situation Room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here.

We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And number one, you start having trade deals. Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn’t put workers at the center of every trade deal.

So we set about turning around the VA, hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who’d put their lives on the line for this country. And we were able to do that. And we took what we learned and we applied it to a national law. As a member of the minority, working with Republicans and Democrats alike, to expand mental healthcare access for veterans nationally.

Donald Trump is part of a corrupt rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else. We’re not gonna solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We’re gonna solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change.

And, American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change. I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it’s an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change, that recruits everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities.

I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it’s breaking families’ backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they’re showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases they’re already years behind. Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids’ educational outcomes are determined by what’s happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them. So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1000 a month, for every American adult, which would put in many cases $2000 a month into families’ pockets so that they can either pay for child care, or if they want, stay home with the child.",14,14,8,12,7,2

I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner. As a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaperman man. As the first woman elected to the US Senate from the State of Minnesota, and a candidate for president of the United States. That’s because we come from a country of shared dreams, and I have had it with the racist attacks. I have had it with the President that says one thing on TV that has your back, and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable, and college. You’re gonna hear a lot of promises up here, but I’m gonna tell you this. Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality. And yes, I will make some simple promises. I can win this.

Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. It doesn’t happen unless America is already in a crisis. An economy that’s not working for everyone. Endless war, climate change, we have lived this. In my industrial midwestern hometown, my generation has lived this, as long as we have been alive, and it’s only accelerating. Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe, when it comes to our climate. By 2030, the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks, and a woman’s right to choose may not even exist. We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.

I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you’ve got to win.

I think that the House will find him guilty of… Worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back National Security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension.

But the fact that the matter is we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election.

I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash ObamaCare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that’s have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And I’m tired of hearing whenever I say these things, “Oh, it’s Republican talking points.” You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that’s going to do that.

He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly, born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soy beans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy. When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration is always going to be about saying, “We need to export American products, not American jobs.” And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy. I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.",9,9,7,9,8,2

We can go into that, I can talk about that if you like. But here’s the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it. A study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4%, plus, or 5%, plus a 4% income tax. If you’re making… If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this healthcare plan.

You’ve got to raise your labor standards, and you’ve got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field.” We can use trade not to undermine American workers, and not to undermine American farms, and not to undermine small businesses in this country.

But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration. And more recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee, and Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen, and for the first time in 45 years we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get US… Get the votes to get the US troops out of that area.",12,12,8,8,17,15

She said, “Boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that’s all there’s ever going to be, but if you’re stubborn and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.” She was a church woman that said, “Without vision, the people will perish.” Well, that’s exactly what we did.

And that’s what’s happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle: No one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it.

I’m living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities, where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day. And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership.

He said, “If it had been a coach, I would have gone with him. If it had been a mentor or a teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.” So what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 plus percent of the shooters we’re talking about are young boys and young men.

The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation. And yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world. And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we’ve done in Northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit.

We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say, “We are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.” And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel, but we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve. What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70% or 80% is unsustainable. So we need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with the United Nations, and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.",13,13,9,9,13,3
test_86.txt,"And I think how we win an election is to bring everyone with us. And yes, I have won in a state, every single time, statewide, I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. He just targeted Minnesota last week, and I’ve done it by getting out there and talking to people, by knowing rural issues and farm issues and bringing metro people with me in this state that had the highest voter turnout in the country. That’s what we want.",5,5,7,4,4,3
test_92.txt,"I’ve met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there, what they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage. If we complement that with investment in world-class pre K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot. They don’t want a handout, they don’t want a job guarantee. They just want a shot, and as president, I will give them that shot.",17,16,9,13,8,5
test_93.txt,"Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tarrifs just doesn’t understand what’s going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0, what’s the central feature? It’s to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits. That’s what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multi-nationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.",7,6,13,4,3,1
test_87.txt,"I’ll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone… Anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That’s all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.",3,3,9,6,3,3
test_78.txt,"Yeah, I think that we’re on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices in setting, as Beto O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today, and whether that’s Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time, short-changing a lot of its workers, not paying them as it should, not giving them the benefits they should, or it’s a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices and that’s what I would do as president.",7,7,9,7,3,3

test_44.txt,"No, Turkey is not US ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people… And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, “We are with you. We’re standing with you.” And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdoğan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy. Now, you tell me, what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States? In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.",8,8,8,10,9,3
test_52.txt,"With regard to… With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I should’ve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote 15 to nothing to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof. I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on, what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan, we should not be engaged, we didn’t have the people with us, we didn’t have our aligned… We didn’t have allies with us, etcetera.",10,11,5,8,6,7

test_109.txt,"Well, thank you, Detroit. To win we have to listen to people, and out there today is Casey Joe’s mom. Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town. She got sick, went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was, “Mama, it’s not my fault” and she died. A lot of Americans say the same thing every day. And that is what I will stand up for, and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids, and didn’t tell the doctors or the patients what was gonna happen. We need someone that has people’s back, we also need someone that can win. And I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin, and Michigan, and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor, just like I did as a prosecutor; and get through the grid lock like I’ve done as a Senator, where I’ve passed over 100 bills where I’ve been the lead Democrat. And last yes, I will govern with integrity. We have a President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.",15,16,5,14,16,14
test_85.txt,"I understand that what we’re all looking for is how we strengthen America’s middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It’s one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now. That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.",9,9,9,4,6,3

test_90.txt,"And you know what, we came back four years later, and won the largest lopsided victory in our city’s history, but more than that, the lesson was there. We didn’t give up, we were taking on America’s toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There’s more work to do, but I haven’t given up on the people, I still live in that community, but this is the big lesson, my staff and my friends and my community told me, “If you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor’s race, but that’s not what life is about.” There’s an old African saying that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.”",9,10,7,12,3,3

test_53.txt,"Well, what Kamala Harris is doing is, unfortunately, continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos, because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making, the leadership and the change that I’m seeking to bring in our foreign policy. Which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive. This is personal to me, because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in the medical unit, where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as Commander-in-Chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always, no, I’m not going to put party interests first.
